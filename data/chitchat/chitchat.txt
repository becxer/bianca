B: You should stop drinking coffee.
A: Look at these marks on my arms.
B: What are they?
A: They are bites.
B: Did the cat bite you?
A: No. The bedbugs in that mattress bit me.
B: Okay. Let's get a new mattress.

A: My laptop is so slow.
B: Buy a new one.
A: I would if I had the money.
B: Why is it so slow?
A: That's a good question.
B: Did you take it to a computer shop?
A: I would if I had the money.
B: Well, I guess you have to live with it.
A: Sometimes I want to throw it out the window.
B: You don't want to do that.
A: Why not?
B: You might hit someone in the head.

A: What's for dinner?
B: I'm not sure.
A: How about a pizza?

A: That's why we need to save money.
B: How much do we need to save?
A: We need to save enough for a down payment.

B: What do you mean?
A: I mean you're wasting your life.
B: I'm having fun.
A: You're sitting there with your mouth open.
B: Who cares?
A: I care. Do something.
B: Okay. I did something.
A: What did you do?

A: Maybe you should record it.
B: The tape recorder is broken.
A: Then you should watch the rerun.
B: Why? I'm watching the original.
A: But you'll be asleep in about one minute.
B: I'm just yawning because the commercials are on.
A: Okay. I'll tell you how the show ends.
B: Zzz.

A: It's Sunday.
B: So?
A: You know what that means.
B: I forgot.
A: Sunday means we go to church.
B: Oh, yeah.
A: Put on a coat and tie.
B: Why?

B: He'll forgive me

A: Did you feed the cat?
B: I'll do that in a minute.
A: The cat is meowing. He's hungry.

A: You shouldn't make him wait.
B: I was doing my homework.
A: The cat doesn't care about your homework.
B: The cat doesn't care about anything.
A: That's the way cats are.
B: All they think about is themselves.
A: Maybe we should get rid of him.
B: Of course not! He's family.

A: I hate shaving.
B: Me too.
A: I just cut myself again.
B: Did you use a new blade?
A: It doesn't matter. Old blades cut, new blades cut.
B: Maybe you should use an electric shaver.
A: They make a lot of noise, but they don't give a close shave.
B: Maybe you should stop shaving.
A: And grow a beard?
B: Sure. Why not?
A: Because food and other stuff sticks in my beard.

A: Excuse me.
B: Yes?
A: Are you reading this paper?
B: Oh, no. Help yourself.
A: I asked because the paper is sitting next to you.
B: Thank you. That's polite of you to ask.

B: Yes, I know. Some people are rude.
A: I always try to be polite.
B: So do I.
A: The world needs more polite people like us.
B: I agree 100 percent.

A: Mom, I want a puppy.
B: Let me think about it.
A: Why do you have to think about it?
B: Because a puppy costs money.
A: No, it doesn't. Puppies are free.
B: Yes, but a puppy needs shots.
A: Shots for what?
B: So it won't get sick. Just like you get shots.
A: I hate shots.
B: And a puppy eats food. Food costs money.
A: No problem. I'll give him food off my plate.
B: Oh, no you don't. Puppies don't eat vegetables.

A: Look at all these kittens!
B: How many are there?
A: Eight.
B: They're all so cute.
A: Yes, but I can't keep them.
B: What are you going to do with them?
A: I'm going to give them away. Do you want one?

A: Which one do you want?
B: That one. The one that's all black.
A: Yes, I like that one, too.
B: I'll call him Blacky.

A: My parents go to church every Sunday.
B: They trust in God.
A: They hope they will go to heaven.
B: They probably will.
A: But no one knows for sure.
B: That's for sure.
A: No one knows what happens after we die.
B: If we are good, we will be happy in heaven with God.
A: That's what many people believe.
B: If we are bad, we will be unhappy forever in hell.
A: I don't want to go to hell.
B: Let's go to church with your parents on Sunday.

A: My husband died.
B: I'm sorry for you.
A: Thank you.
B: When did he die?
A: A couple of months ago.
B: You still miss him.
A: Yes, but I talk to him almost every day.
B: When you go to church?
A: No, when I call him on his cell phone.
B: What do you mean?
A: I buried him with his cell phone.
B: What will you do when the battery dies?

A: Today is Friday the thirteenth.
B: That's a bad day.
A: It's supposed to be unlucky.
B: You're supposed to stay home all day.
A: That's what I do.
B: My friend stayed in a hotel on Friday the thirteenth.
A: That was a mistake.
B: He stayed on the thirteenth floor.
A: What happened?
B: Someone stole his laptop.
A: He was asking for it.
B: He learned his lesson. He's home today.

A: Do you really love me?
B: Of course.
A: Prove it.
B: How can I prove it?
A: Take me to dinner.
B: That's it? That's all I have to do?
A: Take me to a nice restaurant, not to McDonald's.
B: But a nice restaurant costs money.
A: Yes, and you have to make a reservation.
B: That's such a hassle.
A: I knew you didn't love me.
B: Okay, okay! I'll make a reservation right now.

A: My parents are divorced.
B: So are mine.
A: Why did your parents get divorced?
B: My father found a new girlfriend.
A: That's too bad.
B: My mother was hurt and angry.
A: She had good reason. What did she do?
B: She told him to drop his girlfriend.
A: What did your father do?
B: He moved out of our house.
A: I guess he really liked his new girlfriend.
B: Yes, but she left him a year later.

A: My grandma's apartment smells funny.
B: So does mine.
A: I think it's an old people's smell.
B: Really?
A: Yes. I think when you get old, you begin to smell.
B: Like fruit that is too ripe?
A: Yes, just like fruit that is too ripe.
B: But the smell is different.
A: Yes, old people don't smell like fruit.
B: No, they smell like a thrift shop.
A: Yes, a thrift shop has that same smell.
B: Yes, an old smell.

A: The price of stamps goes up and up.
B: I think stamps used to cost a penny.
A: That was a long time ago.
B: It was before I was born.
A: Now a stamp is 42 cents.
B: But in May it will be 44 cents.
A: Have you ever lost a letter in the mail?
B: No, I haven't.
A: Neither have I.
B: So, they do a good job for the money.
A: Yes, they do.
B: Maybe we shouldn't complain.

A: A button came off my shirt.
B: What are you going to do?
A: First, I have to find the button.
B: Where did you lose it?
A: I have no idea.
B: A button is hard to find. Did you look in your pant cuffs?
A: That's a good idea.
B: I found a button in my pant cuffs one time.
A: Let me look. No, it's not there.
B: Many shirts come with an extra button.
A: You're right. This one does have an extra button.
B: Now all you have to do is sew it on.

A: I have to go to the bathroom.
B: You drink too much coffee.
A: But I love coffee.
B: Well, it's your life.
A: You eat too much chocolate.
B: I don't think so.
A: Have you looked in the mirror?
B: Do you think I'm getting fat?
A: I didn't say that.
B: What did you say?
A: I said I have to go to the bathroom.
B: That's what I thought you said.

A: Did you do the laundry?
B: Yes, I did.
A: What did you wash?

B: Yes, and I put the pillowcases on the pillows.

A: Do you listen to the radio?
B: I listen day and night.
A: What do you listen to?
B: Mostly talk radio.
A: What's that?
B: People talk about current events.
A: What do they say?
B: They say they want change.
A: What kind of change?
B: They want tax cuts.
A: Why do they want tax cuts?
B: Because tax cuts will save them money.

A: Mom, I'm hungry.
B: Look in the fridge.
A: I'm looking. There's nothing to eat.
B: Are you sure?
A: It's almost empty.
B: I went to the market yesterday.
A: I don't see anything.
B: I bought lots of oranges and apples.
A: I don't want fruit. I want something tasty.
B: Eat the fruit. It's good for you.
A: Next time you go to the market, let me go with you.
B: No, thank you. All you want to eat are hot dogs and candy bars.

A: What is there to eat?
B: I don't know. Look in the fridge.
A: I think I'll make a sandwich.
B: What kind?
A: A ham sandwich.
B: The bread is in the cabinet.
A: Where's the mustard?
B: It's in the fridge, I think.
A: Oh, yes, here it is. Do you want a sandwich?
B: Yes, that sounds nice.
A: How about some potato chips?
B: Yes. And a pickle, if we have any.

A: It's time for your bath, young lady.
B: But, Mom, I'm not dirty.
A: You need a bath every day.
B: Why?
A: Because you don't want to smell bad.
B: I don't smell bad.
A: That's what you think.
B: If I smelled bad, I could smell me.
A: I can smell you.
B: I can smell you, too.
A: That's my perfume.
B: When can I wear perfume?

A: Something's wrong with my computer.
B: Exactly what?
A: All I get is a black screen.
B: What's the matter?
A: I think I know, because this happened before.
B: What happened before?
A: My hard drive crashed.
B: Oh, no. That's bad news.
A: It sure is, but I'm going to call HP first, just to make sure.
B: Will you lose all your files?
A: No, I always back up my files.
B: You're smart.

A: I called HP about my computer.
B: What did they say?
A: They said I need a new hard drive.
B: That's too bad. How much is a new one?
A: It's not too much, only about $85.
B: Plus installation?
A: No, my hard drive is easy to remove and replace.
B: Really?
A: Yes, it's just a couple of screws.
B: That's nice.
A: It's a lot better than paying someone $60.
B: If my hard drive crashes, I'll just call you.

A: What's your email address?
B: It's bluedog123.
A: Bluedog123. Are you sure that's all?
B: Yes.
A: No. That's incomplete.
B: What do you mean?
A: What's your mailing address?
B: 456 Cherry Drive, Pasadena, CA 91170.
A: That's correct.
B: So what's the problem?
A: Bluedog123 is just the street. You have to give me the city, state, and ZIP 
code.
B: Oh, I get it. My email address is bluedog123@yahoo.com.

A: I'm going to take a nap.
B: You should unplug the phone.
A: That's a good idea.
B: Do you want me to wake you in an hour?
A: No, thanks. Just let me sleep until I wake up.
B: I'll start dinner at 6:00.
A: Okay. I think I'll be awake by then.
B: If not, your nose will wake you up.
A: You mean I will smell the food cooking?
B: You might even dream about dinner.
A: I don't think I'm going to dream about anything. I'm really tired.
B: Have a nice nap.

A: That was a nice funeral.
B: Yes, dad, it was.
A: The son gave a nice speech about his father.
B: It was long, too.
A: I think it was about 45 minutes long.
B: But it went by fast. It was interesting.
A: I liked it.
B: I'll give you a speech like that, too.
A: Do you think anyone will come to my funeral?
B: Of course.
A: I think only the family will be there.
B: You have lots of friends. They will be there, too!

A: Yikes! What was that noise?
B: I had to blow my nose.
A: Did you have to blow right next to the phone?
B: Did you hear that?
A: Of course I heard that. I thought a plane had crashed into your house.
B: It wasn't that loud.
A: I will blow my nose sometime for you, and you'll see.
B: Okay. I'll take your word for it.
A: I thought you had an elephant in your house.
B: You're funny.
A: What did you say? I think I've gone deaf.
B: I'm going into the bathroom to blow my nose. I'll be right back.

A: I have lots of friends.
B: Really? How many do you have?
A: I don't know, maybe one hundred.
B: That is a lot of friends. Do you have a best friend?
A: Of course. I have lots of best friends.
B: How many best friends do you have?
A: I think about twenty-five.
B: Hmm. I have only one best friend.
A: I feel sorry for you.
B: I have only a few friends.
A: You must be lonely. I will share my friends with you.
B: That's very nice of you.

A: Don't you ever cheat on me.
B: Why would I do that?
A: Because men like to cheat.
B: Some men do, but not me.
A: I'm watching you.
B: I'm an open book. Watch me all you want.
A: If I catch you, you'll be sorry.
B: You won't catch me, because I love you. I'm not a cheater.
A: I will poke your eyes out. 
B: I don't want any other woman.
A: I will chop your toes off, one by one.
B: Honey, please. You're the only woman for me, forever. I swear it.

A: I hate to go outside.
B: Me too.
A: Why do you hate to go outside?
B: I meet too many jerks.
A: I agree.
B: This city is full of jerks.
A: Rude people are everywhere.
B: But what can you do?
A: You can yell at them.
B: And they will yell back at you.
A: Yelling doesn't do any good.
B: No. The best thing to do is just stay home.

A: Will you look at this form?
B: Are you having problems with it?
A: I don't understand some things.
B: Let me help you.
A: What does "MI" mean?
B: "MI" stands for Middle Initial.
A: What does "MM/DD/YY" mean?
B: That means Month/Day/Year. Use numbers.
A: I don't understand.
B: For example, if your birth date is January 12, 1987, write 01/12/87.
A: Oh. That's simple enough.
B: Always print clearly, and fill in the bubbles completely.

A: Let's go to the animal shelter.
B: What do you want to do?
A: I want to get a puppy for my son.
B: That will make him so happy.
A: I'll get him one of those little dogs. 
B: One that won't grow up too big.
A: And eat too much.
B: Do you know which one he would like?
A: Oh, yes, I took him there yesterday. He showed me one that he really liked.
B: I bet you had to drag him away.
A: He wanted to take it home yesterday.
B: I wonder what he'll name it.

A: What's the weather like?
B: I don't know. I just woke up.
A: Why don't you look outside?
B: Okay. It looks like rain.
A: Why do you say that?
B: The sky is gray.
A: Is it raining right now?
B: No.
A: How do you know?
B: The street isn't wet.
A: I have to go shopping today.
B: You'd better take an umbrella.

A: I can't believe how hot it is.
B: It's not even noon yet.
A: That means it will get hotter.
B: I am dying from the heat.
A: Turn on the air conditioner.
B: It doesn't work.
A: What happened?
B: I don't know.
A: Did you call the repairman?
B: Of course.
A: When is he coming?
B: He's busy. He said next week.

A: I'll be glad when winter comes.
B: Why is that?
A: Because I love the snow.
B: Yes, the snow is fun.
A: Last year we made a big snowman.
B: How big was it?
A: It was seven feet tall.
B: How long did it take?
A: It took us all day.
B: Did you give him a nose?
A: Of course. We gave him a big carrot for a nose.
B: Let me help you make one this year.

A: I'm going to the bank.
B: What do you need to do?
A: I need to withdraw some money.
B: How are you going to do that?
A: I'll just use the ATM.
B: What's that?
A: It's the Automatic Teller Machine.
B: It gives you money?
A: I just insert my debit card into the machine.
B: And it gives you money?
A: Well, it gives me money, but it's my own money.
B: Oh. What good is that? I thought it gave you free money.

A: Did you put the blue bin out on the street?
B: Oh, no. I forgot.
A: Well, you'd better take it out front.
B: What time does the recycle truck come by?
A: It usually gets here at noon on Tuesday, which is tomorrow.
B: I'll just take it out to the street tomorrow morning.
A: Oh, no, you don't.
B: What do you mean?
A: Every morning you get up late and rush off to work late.
B: Do you think I'll forget to do it?
A: You'll remember to do it, but you won't have time to do it.
B: Okay, I'll take it out front right now.

A: Are you ready?
B: Ready for what?
A: Ready for the big switch.
B: What are you talking about?
A: The nation is switching to digital TV.
B: Oh. Of course I'm ready.
A: Did you buy the converter?
B: No, I don't need a converter because I bought a digital TV.
A: How much was that?
B: It was only about $120 for a 13-inch screen.
A: Does it pick up any digital channels?
B: Oh, yes. I get six Korean channels but nothing in English!

A: People are funny.
B: They sure are.
A: Did you hear about the pilot?
B: The one that stole a small plane?
A: Yes, he stole a plane in Canada and flew into the U.S.
B: Did they catch him?
A: Yes. After two U.S. fighter jets followed him for an hour, he landed on a highway.
B: Did he crash?
A: No, he just landed the plane and walked to a restaurant.
B: Did the cops find out why he flew into the U.S.?
A: His life sucked. He was hoping a fighter jet would shoot him down.
B: Poor guy.

A: The police need our help finding a robber.
B: How do you know?
A: The TV news is reporting a bank robbery.
B: Do they know what the robber looks like?
A: Yes, he's 6 feet tall, 200 pounds, black hair, and about 30 years old.
B: What race is he?
A: They didn't say.
B: The TV news doesn't tell us the race anymore.
A: Of course not. That would be racist.
B: But how can we identify someone if we don't know their race?
A: Don't ask me.
B: Then they also shouldn't tell us if the robber is male or female, because that is sexist.

A: Don't wipe your nose on your sleeve.
B: But I don't have a tissue.
A: Then go find a tissue in the bathroom.
B: I didn't have time to get one from there.
A: Your sleeves are not tissues.
B: But Mom, all my friends use their sleeves.
A: That doesn't make it right.
B: I saw Dad wipe his nose on his sleeve yesterday.
A: I will talk to your father about that.
B: I bet Dad did it all the time when he was my age.
A: Your daddy was a good little boy.
B: How do you know? Were you his mommy, too?

A: I'm worried.
B: Worried about what?
A: I'm getting married.
B: You should be happy, not worried.
A: I am happy, but marriage is a lot of responsibility.
B: Yes, you have to take care of your wife.
A: And I have to take care of our children.
B: Are you going to start a family?
A: Yes. We want to have a little boy and a little girl.
B: That sounds wonderful.
A: Except we can't afford it!
B: No wonder you're worried.

A: I don't get art.
B: Or artists.
A: They're in a different world.
B: I saw a painting of a jar that was full of pencils.
A: The artist said the jar was both full and empty.
B: But it was full of pencils! How could he say it was empty?
A: Artists see things differently.
B: Did you ever see anything that Picasso painted?
A: Of course! He's world famous.
B: Did he ever take art lessons?
A: I can't believe it. I drew paintings like that in third grade.
B: Where are they? Maybe they are worth millions.

A: What's the point?
B: The point of what?
A: Of living.
B: Who knows? You live, and then you die.
A: We must be here for some reason.
B: Maybe we're here to have fun.
A: Then why aren't I having fun?
B: Because you're thinking too much.
A: So I should stop thinking?
B: Stop thinking about what the point is.
A: Okay. I'll start thinking about having some fun.
B: Just be patient. Fun doesn't come along every five minutes.

A: Beer is a powerful drug.
B: So are cigarettes.
A: Which would you prefer?
B: What do you mean?
A: When you die and go to heaven, they will offer you beer or cigarettes.
B: I could pick only one or the other?
A: Yes. Nothing's perfect, not even in heaven.
B: Boy, that's a tough one.
A: What's so tough about it? Of course, I would pick cigarettes.
B: But cigarettes taste much better when you have a cold beer.
A: Well, you can't have everything.
B: I don't think I want to go to your heaven.

A: My pants have a hole in the front pocket.
B: You shouldn't carry pens in your pocket.
A: Yesterday a pen fell through my pants onto my shoe.
B: Lucky for you it wasn't a sharp knife.
A: Who carries a sharp knife in their pocket?
B: Criminals, of course.
A: Anyway, I have to fix the hole.
B: You can sew it up or use an iron-on patch.
A: Tell me about this patch.
B: The patch has glue. The hot iron melts the glue so the patch sticks on.
A: That sounds a lot easier than sewing.
B: It is. But after about ten washings, the glue washes off.

A: Do you know any good jokes?
B: I can't remember jokes.
A: Neither can I.
B: They go in one ear and out the other.
A: Who makes up all these jokes?
B: Who knows? But there must be a hundred new ones every day.
A: Yes, just in English alone.
B: I wonder if every language has jokes.
A: Of course! People everywhere like good jokes.
B: What do you think people joke about the most?
A: I think most jokes are about women.
B: Oh, really? I think most jokes are about men!

A: You're very lucky.
B: Why do you say that?
A: You speak two languages.
B: Well, my English isn't perfect.
A: No one speaks perfect English.
B: Maybe I will be the first!
A: I've been thinking about learning Spanish.
B: Spanish is easy. I'll be happy to teach you.
A: How long will it take me to learn?
B: I think it will only take you a year or two.
A: How soon can we begin?
B: Ahora! That means right now.

A: Do you know what today is?
B: Yes, it's April 22.
A: It's more than just a date.
B: Is it your birthday or anniversary?
A: No, it's Earth Day.
B: What's that?
A: It's a yearly reminder to take care of our planet.
B: Oh, you mean like reuse things and recycle stuff?
A: Yes. We need to think green, save water, and stop using plastic bags.
B: How about if I take shorter showers?
A: That's a good idea, because showers waste a lot of water.
B: From now on I'll spend only 20 minutes in the shower.

A: Poetry sucks.
B: I don't know anyone who likes it.
A: Some of it is okay, I guess.
B: Yes, the poems that rhyme and are easy to remember.
A: Like "One, two, buckle my shoe."
B: But people still write poems.
A: No one makes any money at it.
B: Shakespeare was a poet.
A: Did he get rich from his poetry?
B: Probably not.
A: Poems are a little bit like songs.
B: Yes, but songs have music. Without music, songs would suck, too.

A: How smart are you?
B: I don't know. I think I'm average.
A: Did you ever take an IQ test?
B: No, I never did. All I know is that I got A's and B's in school.
A: I wish I was really smart.
B: Don't be ridiculous.
A: What do you mean?
B: If you're going to make a wish, wish that you were really rich or famous.
A: Don't you ever wonder what it's like to be super-smart?
B: It must be very lonely.
A: Why's that?
B: Because if you're super-smart, no one understands what you're saying.

A: I missed the TV news last night. What was on?
B: Nothing that would pass as news.
A: What's the weather going to be like this weekend?
B: I don't know. Whenever the weather comes on, I switch channels.
A: What was the lead story on the news?
B: Some actress was in court for driving without a license.
A: What was the second story?
B: Some actor married a woman young enough to be his daughter.
A: What was the third story?
B: A bull chased a man in a supermarket.
A: Wasn't there anything about Octo-Mom?
B: Of course. She's going to hire a nanny for her eight infants.

A: What are you going to do about your death?
B: Well, mostly I'll try to avoid it.
A: I mean, are you going to get buried or cremated?
B: My wife and I will be cremated.
A: Are you going to be buried next to each other?
B: Oh, no. Our ashes will be shaken into the ocean.
A: You're not going to be buried?
B: A coffin costs too much and takes up too much space.
A: Yes, but it will be in a cemetery where your children can visit you.
B: Children seldom visit their parents in a cemetery.
A: That's true. A cemetery is for dead people, not living people.
B: We figure our kids can visit us whenever they go to the beach.

A: Did you wipe your feet? 
B: Yes, of course I wiped my feet.
A: Then why is there mud on the carpet?
B: I don't know. It's not my mud.
A: Well, someone brought it into the house.
B: Look at the bottom of my shoes\x97they're clean.
A: Of course they're clean. You left all the mud on the carpet.
B: Okay, I'll get the vacuum cleaner.
A: Don't vacuum it now.
B: Don't you want me to clean up the mud?
A: Wait till it dries. It will be easier to vacuum.
B: Next time I will be more careful.

A: What are you getting for your mom?
B: What are you talking about?
A: Sunday is Mother's Day.
B: This Sunday?
A: Of course. It's all over the news.
B: I thought it was next Sunday.
A: Well, you'd better get her something.
B: I'll get her a nice card.
A: Is that it?
B: Yes. That's all I ever give her.
A: She raised you, and all you ever give her is a card?
B: It's okay. She knows that I love her.

A: I don't like our flag.
B: What's the matter with it?
A: It's too much like other flags.
B: Yes, a lot of flags have stripes.
A: A flag should be pretty.
B: What should our flag look like?
A: It should have a pretty woman on it.
B: That's ridiculous!
A: You don't like pretty women?
B: Of course I do. But not on our flag!
A: Every nation should have a pretty woman on their flag.
B: You can't go to war carrying a flag with a woman on it!

A: I had a busy morning.
B: What did you do?
A: I watered all the plants.
B: You have a lot of plants.
A: Then I did my laundry.
B: That takes some time.
A: I took the dog for a walk.
B: I'll bet he enjoyed his walk.
A: I vacuumed the entire house.
B: That's a lot of work.
A: And then I made lunch.
B: I'll bet you were hungry!

A: I don't have long distance service with my home phone.
B: So how do you make long distance calls?
A: I use a calling card.
B: Where do you get that?
A: I buy it at the dollar store.
B: How much is it?
A: It's one dollar for 100 minutes.
B: That's only a penny a minute!
A: It's a great price. But you have to dial a lot of numbers.
B: How many?
A: First you dial seven numbers, then ten numbers, then ten more numbers.
B: Yikes. I think I'll keep my long distance service.

A: I've got a date for you.
B: Oh, really?
A: Are you interested?
B: Maybe. What is she like?
A: She's got a great personality.
B: Uh-oh. That means that she's fat and ugly.
A: She's cute.
B: Okay, so she's not ugly; she's just fat.
A: She weighs 98 pounds.
B: Okay, she's not fat. So what's the problem with her?
A: Who said there is a problem with her?
B: The problem is she has no problems\x97she's too good for me!

A: I think you're very pretty.
B: Thank you.
A: Would you have dinner with me?
B: I would like to.
A: Can I pick you up Friday night?
B: What time?
A: Eight o'clock.
B: That sounds great.
A: We'll go to a French restaurant.
B: I've never been to a French restaurant.
A: I think you'll love the food.
B: I'm not going to eat any snails!

A: You have pretty eyes.
B: Thank you. So do you.
A: I wish my eyes were blue.
B: What's the matter with green eyes?
A: Nothing, except my favorite color is blue.
B: Maybe in your next life you'll have blue eyes.
A: But what if I'm a fish in my next life?
B: I think some fish have blue eyes.
A: I hope I don't come back as a fish.
B: I hope I come back as a cat.
A: Cats have beautiful eyes.
B: I would love to have blue cat-eyes.

A: I love you.
B: I love you, too.
A: I loved you the first day I saw you.
B: It was love at first sight?
A: Yes, it was love at first sight.
B: I didn't love you at first.
A: I know. I had to chase you for a while.
B: Yes, you chased me and then you caught me.
A: Now you're mine forever.
B: And you're mine forever.
A: We'll grow old together.
B: And be happy together.

A: I'm in love with that girl.
B: Have you told her?
A: Of course not.
B: Why not?
A: She would laugh at me.
B: How do you know?
A: Because they always do.
B: Maybe she's different.
A: They're all the same.
B: Just ask her out to dinner.
A: And then what?
B: And then she'll know that you like her.

A: Give me a hug.
B: I'm not in the mood.
A: What's the matter?
B: I saw you looking at that woman.
A: What woman?
B: You know, that woman with the big boobs.
A: I was not looking at her.
B: You were, too.
A: I'm not interested in her.
B: Then why were you looking at her?
A: I was looking at something else.
B: Oh, really? Then spend tonight looking at the sofa.

A: Would you like to go on a blind date?
B: You must be joking.
A: No, I'm serious.
B: I don't want to date a blind woman.
A: A blind date doesn't mean that she is blind!
B: What does it mean?
A: A blind date is a date with someone you don't know.
B: Why would I date someone I don't even know?
A: To try something new and exciting.
B: What if I don't like her?
A: Then you don't date her again.

A: I have a date tomorrow night.
B: Really? Who with?
A: A girl I met at the market.
B: You met a girl at the supermarket?
A: She was standing behind me in a really slow line at the checkout counter.
B: What did you say to her?
A: I had two pineapples in my cart, and she asked where I had found them.
B: She asked you about your pineapples?
A: I told her I had gotten the last two on the shelf, but I offered her one of mine.
B: That was nice of you.
A: She asked me how she could return the favor, so I asked her out.
B: Sometimes a slow line can be a good thing.

A: Did you have a date Friday night?
B: Yes, in fact, I did.
A: Who did you go out with?
B: A man I met in a coffee shop.
A: Where did you go?
B: We went to a nice restaurant.
A: Anywhere else?
B: Then we went to a jazz club.
A: That sounds like a nice date.
B: Yes, it was pleasant.
A: But you won't date him again?
B: No. He was nice, but there was no chemistry.

A: I had the worst date the other night.
B: What happened?
A: First of all, he was half an hour late.
B: That's not a good start.
A: Then he didn't bother to apologize.
B: That's rude.
A: Then he drove too fast to the restaurant.
B: That's dangerous.
A: I thought about getting out and taking a taxi home.
B: What happened at the restaurant?
A: We had a $40 meal, and he left a $1 tip!
B: I guess you can't go back to that restaurant.

A: I don't like that man.
B: Why not?
A: He's a dirty old man.
B: What do you mean?
A: He's old enough to be my father, yet he asked me out.
B: Well, you can't blame a man for asking.
A: He should act his age.
B: But a lot of old people are still interested in dating.
A: They should find a nice hobby.
B: Just wait until you're 50 years old.
A: Dating will be the furthest thing from my mind.
B: That's what you say now. Wait till you're 50.

A: Does your girlfriend ever make you angry?
B: Sometimes.
A: What does she do?
B: Just yesterday, I told her I wouldn't trade her for all the money in the world.
A: That was a nice thing to say.
B: That's what I thought.
A: What did she say?
B: She laughed! She didn't believe me.
A: That wasn't very nice of her.
B: She said that nothing is more important to me than money.
A: What did you say?
B: I told her I wouldn't trade her for any other woman in the world.

A: Some people have good noses.
B: I wish I had a good nose. Mine is way too big.
A: I don't mean good-looking. I mean good-smelling.
B: Oh. But that can be a curse.
A: Yes, because you can be too sensitive to odors.
B: I'll say. My girlfriend has a nose like a drug dog.
A: Did she catch you using drugs?
B: Sort of. She knows whenever I sneak a cigarette.
A: You don't need a good nose for that\x97cigarettes stink.
B: But when I sneak just one cigarette in the morning, she can smell it that evening!
A: Boy, that is a good nose.
B: I told her she should apply for a job at customs.

A: Who did you vote for?
B: I voted for Obama.
A: Me too.
B: He will be a great president.
A: Everyone likes him.
B: He's a good speaker.
A: And he's really smart.
B: He will solve our problems.
A: He will end the war.
B: The next four years will be good years.
A: I'll vote for him next time, too.
B: I think everyone will.

A: The election is next week.
B: Who are you voting for?
A: I'm not voting for the mayor.
B: Why not?
A: He made promises that he didn't keep.
B: Like what?
A: He promised to hire 1,000 more police officers.
B: How many did he hire?
A: One hundred!
B: Maybe he had a good reason.
A: Maybe he's just a liar.
B: Maybe I'll vote for someone else, too.

A: I can't believe he won the election.
B: Only 15 percent of the voters turned out.
A: That is a joke.
B: Voting is so important, but people don't bother.
A: Many people think their vote doesn't matter.
B: The mayor won by only 2,000 votes.
A: We're stuck with him for four more years.
B: Voting is so easy. You can even mail your ballot in.
A: All you have to do is vote and put a stamp on it.
B: How easy is that?
A: I guess people just don't care.
B: They'll care when they see their taxes go up.

A: Well, we have a new president.
B: But we have the same old problems.
A: Well, he's made a few changes.
B: Like what?
A: I think he closed the bowling alley in the White House.
B: Oh, yeah. He's changing it to a basketball court.
A: Who's paying for that?
B: I think we are!
A: Well, that's okay, as long as it helps him relax and think more clearly.
B: Yes, we need a relaxed president who thinks clearly.
A: Do any other world leaders have a basketball court?
B: They will. You know America always leads the way.

A: People say that everybody loves Obama.
B: Well, more than 50 million people voted for McCain.
A: That's 50 million people who don't love Obama.
B: Obama's got four years to make everyone happy.
A: He's never going to make everyone happy.
B: Can you imagine being President?
A: Everyone wants you to solve their problems.
B: I have enough stress from trying to solve my own problems.
A: You and everybody else.
B: I would never want to be President.
A: But think about all the power you'd have.
B: I prefer my quiet little life to all the power in the world.

A: Did you read this article?
B: What article?
A: It says the mayor spends only 11 percent of his time on city duties.
B: Only 11 percent?
A: About 50 percent of the time he's traveling.
B: Where does he travel to?
A: Oh, all over the world.
B: But he's supposed to be making our city a better place.
A: He's visiting other cities to get ideas.
B: Can't he just go online?
A: The rest of the time he's raising money for his reelection.
B: Well, he'll never get reelected once this news gets out.

A: Who did you vote for for president?
B: I voted for Ralph Nader.
A: Who in the world is Ralph Nader?
B: He's the best man for president.
A: Why's that?
B: He hates corporations.
A: Well, most corporations do think only about money.
B: He hates Democrats and Republicans.
A: Well, they do put their party before their country.
B: He's the only candidate that I trust.
A: But he didn't have a chance. Nobody voted for him!
B: Sooner or later, voters will wake up.

A: I don't know why I bother to vote.
B: Why's that?
A: What good does it do?
B: You get to put someone in power that you like.
A: Only if my candidate wins.
B: Well, he can't win unless you and others vote for him.
A: But even if my candidate wins, he'll break his promises.
B: That's true. They promise anything just so they get elected.
A: And when elected, they go their own way.
B: They forget who put them in power.
A: They forget where they came from.
B: Maybe you should run for office.

A: That election for U.S. Senator stunk.
B: What do you mean?
A: There were more votes than voters!
B: But that's impossible.
A: Officials said that it's possible.
B: Did they explain how it's possible?
A: No. They said there are some things you can't explain.
B: So are they going to hold another election?
A: No. That will cost too much money.
B: So it's better to save money than to have an honest election?
A: Well, the Democratic Party says it was an honest election.
B: Of course they say that\x97their man won!

A: I see that former President Bush is at a conference.
B: Yes. He's telling jokes about his eight years as president.
A: Yes, those eight years were a lot of fun for everyone.
B: Only 4,000 American soldiers were killed overseas.
A: Not to mention 40,000 wounded soldiers.
B: But Bush visited some of them in the hospital once.
A: That's nice that he found the time to make a visit.
B: He spoke to them and made them feel better.
A: Did he speak to every family that lost a soldier?
B: No, he didn't have time to do that.
A: Well, he's got plenty of time now!
B: No, he's too busy writing a book about how hard it was to be president.

A: Did you get your Official Sample Ballot?
B: Yes, with the Voter Instructions.
A: How are you going to vote?
B: Same as ever, by mail. All it costs me is a 42-cent stamp.
A: I meant, are you going to vote for or against the new taxes?
B: Against all of them, of course.
A: But we need new taxes to pay for highways, schools, and prisons.
B: We've already voted for new taxes to pay for all that stuff!
A: That's true. Where did that money go?
B: Our legislators spent it on first-class travel all over the world.
A: They are having a good time with our money.
B: So when are we going to stop giving them more?

A: Have you decided how you are going to vote?
B: Do you mean on Measures 1, 2, and 3?
A: Yes. The ones that will improve our schools, roads, and hospitals.
B: You mean the measures that will raise our taxes.
A: But the TV ads say that our taxes will not increase.
B: Do you believe the TV ads?
A: I like the one where the fireman tells us why we should vote Yes.
B: Don't believe him! Whatever the TV ads tell you, the opposite is true.
A: But the title of Measure 1 is "Better Schools at No Cost."
B: The title should be "Better Schools at Huge Cost."
A: I can't believe that they would lie to us.
B: Of course they lie\x97that's what politicians do!

A: Did you see "Titanic"?
B: Yes. It is a great movie.
A: I saw it twelve times.
B: I saw it eight times.
A: I have the DVD.
B: So do I.
A: Let's go to your home.
B: We can watch my DVD.
A: And then we can go to my home.
B: And watch your DVD.
A: I always cry at the end.
B: Me too. It's so sad.

A: Let's play cards.
B: I don't know any card games.
A: I'll teach you one.
B: Okay. What will you teach me?
A: It's called poker.
B: Is it easy to learn?
A: Yes, it will only take about 30 minutes.
B: Okay. Teach me how to play.
A: We each get five cards.
B: Oh, look. I have four tens.
A: That's great, but you're not supposed to tell me.
B: Oh. Sorry. Okay, I don't have four tens.

A: I'm a good card player.
B: Why is that?
A: Because I watch the other players.
B: What do you mean?
A: People will tell you if they have a good hand.
B: How do they do that?
A: For example, a friend of mine licks his lips.
B: When he licks his lips, you know he has a good hand?
A: I know he has a good hand, so I don't bet.
B: He never wins your money?
A: Nope, and it drives him crazy.
B: He knows you can't read his mind. Maybe he thinks you're cheating.

A: Turn the radio down, please.
B: But I'm listening to it.
A: Well, listen to it more quietly.
B: I can't wait till I grow up.
A: What will you do?
B: I will play the radio as loud as I want.
A: That's okay with me.
B: I will have a radio in every room of my house.
A: Remind me to never visit you.
B: All the radios will be on extra loud.
A: Your neighbors will hate you.
B: If they don't like it, they can move.

A: I hope I win the lotto.
B: Your chances are very small.
A: But you can't win if you don't play.
B: Ha! You can't win if you do play.
A: Someone has to win.
B: That's what everyone says.
A: It might as well be me.
B: That's what everyone says.
A: You're trying to tell me something.
B: That didn't take long.
A: You think I should quit playing.
B: Save your money for school.

A: What's on TV?
B: Nothing much.
A: What about the baseball game?
B: It got rained out.
A: Rained out?
B: Yes, rained out.
A: How could that be?
B: Well, you can't play baseball in a rainstorm.
A: I thought they were playing under a dome.
B: The dome doesn't close.
A: Why doesn't it close?
B: Who knows? They said they'll fix it before next season.

A: Can I try your coffee?
B: Sure. Here you go.
A: Hmm, that's not bad.
B: There's nothing in it.
A: What do you mean?
B: I mean, it's just coffee.
A: I figured that.
B: It's not too bitter for you?
A: It's a little bitter, but it's okay.
B: There's no sugar or cream in it.
A: No, it's a taste you have to get used to.
B: Sort of like beer.

A: Let's take a walk.
B: What's the weather like?
A: Let me step outside and see.
B: It's a little chilly, right?
A: Yes, it is.
B: I'll put on my cap.
A: Wear a jacket, too.
B: I wonder if I should bring my gloves.
A: Maybe you should, just in case it gets colder.
B: I'll put a glove in each pocket.
A: We'll get warmer as we walk.
B: Yes, but it gets colder as the sun goes down.

A: Look at the car chase on TV!
B: That driver is crazy.
A: I can't believe he hasn't crashed.
B: How fast is he going?
A: They say he's going 80 miles per hour.
B: He's going to kill someone.
A: Look! He just hit that car.
B: Oh, my goodness. No one is safe on the streets.
A: Now he's slowing down.
B: Maybe he ran out of gas.
A: Look! He just got out of the car and started running.
B: I hope the police catch him.

A: TV news is so stupid.
B: They shouldn't even call it news.
A: Last night they told us about a cat in a sofa.
B: Yesterday they told us about a dog in a pipe.
A: Last week they told us about a bear in a back yard.
B: Last month they told us about a mouse in a restaurant.
A: The weatherman tells us the temperature in every town.
B: The sports guy shows us players fighting.
A: They always tell us "what's next."
B: They always make "what's next" sound exciting, but it never is.
A: It's more like news for kids.
B: They should have kid reporters.

A: I love my computer.
B: Computers are so cool.
A: I love to go online.
B: The Internet is amazing.
A: You can travel all over the world.
B: I know. I went to China yesterday.
A: What did you do?
B: I stood on the Great Wall and looked all around.
A: What was it like?
B: It was like the real thing.
A: It was like being there?
B: Yes, I felt like I was actually there.

A: The Beatles are the best.
B: They are the best musical group ever.
A: I love all their songs.
B: I don't know which one I like the best.
A: I like the ones I can sing along with.
B: So do I, like "She Loves You."
A: "She loves you, Yeah, yeah, yeah!..."
B: "\x85And you know you should be glad!"
A: What a great song.
B: How about "Let It Be?"
A: Oh, yes! "Let it be, let it be\x85"
B: "\x85There will be an answer, let it be!"

A: Let's go to a movie.
B: I'd rather not.
A: Why not?
B: You know I don't like crowds.
A: Let's go to an early movie.
B: Okay, that won't be very crowded.
A: What would you like to see?
B: Oh, I don't care. You're the one who wants to go out.
A: Well, I want to see "The Pursuit of Happyness."
B: What have you heard about it?
A: It's based on a true story about a divorced man and his young son.
B: Well, I hope it has a happy ending.

A: What's your favorite thing to do?
B: I like to watch people.
A: That's your favorite thing to do?
B: Well, it's one of them.
A: Where do you go to watch people?
B: My girlfriend and I sit outside Starbucks.
A: That sounds like a good spot.
B: We watch people walk by with their dogs.
A: I guess you see lots of different dogs.
B: We don't even know what kind most of them are.
A: There are lots of different kinds, but they all have one thing in common.
B: Yes, they love to sniff each other when they meet.

A: They call him Father Dollar Bill.
B: Yes, he was on the TV news today.
A: Every Easter Sunday he gives away money.
B: Is it his money?
A: No. Movie stars give him money to give to homeless people.
B: How much money does he give away?
A: This year he gave away $15,000.
B: That's a lot of money.
A: He gave $100 to people in wheelchairs.
B: What about the other homeless people?
A: They got $1 each.
B: People stood in line just to get one dollar?!

A: Old movies are the best.
B: Even though they're in black and white.
A: A good story is more important than color.
B: Actors didn't curse back then.
A: And there was no violence.
B: People today don't like that.
A: No, today people like lots of action.
B: I like a good story.
A: I like to see actors who are like real people.
B: Like real people with real problems.
A: They still make movies like that.
B: Yes, but they never make much money.

A: Do you get PBS on TV?
B: Yes, everybody gets the Public Broadcasting System.
A: It puts me to sleep.
B: Tell me about it.
A: A gardening show follows a knitting show.
B: A cooking show follows a sewing show.
A: A travel show follows another travel show.
B: I'll say! I've gone around the world a dozen times already!
A: Now they're adding old TV shows to the old movies.
B: I sure would like to see something interesting for a change.
A: If more people donate money, PBS could offer new shows.
B: Who wants to donate? Public TV should be free.

A: I love to watch "Judge Judy."
B: Is that a TV show?
A: Yes. It's on every afternoon.
B: What's so good about it?
A: They have interesting lawsuits.
B: Such as?
A: Yesterday, a woman complained about a cell phone she bought on eBay.
B: Was something wrong with the phone?
A: It works only in Canada.
B: Did the seller know that?
A: Yes, and he didn't tell the buyer.
B: I hope Judge Judy made the seller take the phone back.

A: That woman is a very good singer.
B: Yes, but she looks like a man.
A: What difference does it make?
B: Female singers are supposed to be pretty.
A: Singers are supposed to sound good.
B: They should look good, too.
A: There are lots of ugly men singers.
B: Men singers don't have to look good.
A: Then neither do women singers.
B: Well, I would never buy her CD.
A: But you would buy her CD if she was pretty?
B: Yes. I would buy all of her CDs.

A: All the TV stations are going to go digital.
B: Yes, that will occur next month.
A: Most of them are already broadcasting in digital.
B: The digital signal is very clear.
A: Oh, no, it isn't!
B: What do you mean?
A: I can't get a single channel.
B: Do you have a digital TV?
A: Of course. But I don't have cable.
B: You don't need to have cable, but you do need a good antenna.
A: But I have rabbit ears.
B: Rabbit ears aren't strong enough. Buy a digital antenna.

A: I love salads.
B: Me too.
A: I usually eat a simple salad.
B: What do you put in it?
A: Just lettuce, tomato, and celery.
B: That's it?
A: I add some pepper and salt.
B: I always put cheese in my salads.
A: Yes, cheese is nice.
B: What kind of dressing do you use?
A: I pour lots of French dressing on top.
B: Me too. French dressing is so delicious! Who cares about calories?

A: I love cheese.
B: Me too.
A: Where does cheese come from?
B: It comes from cows.
A: So we get cheese from cows, and we get milk, too?
B: Yes, we do.
A: What else do we get from cows?
B: We get hamburgers and steak.
A: Oh, that's so delicious.
B: We also get leather.
A: We get a lot of things from cows, don't we?
B: Yes. A cow is man's best friend.

A: I used to work in a deli.
B: How did you like it?
A: I loved it!
B: Did you get free food?
A: I ate free cheese and meat every day.
B: That sounds like a great job.
A: Whatever a customer ordered, I sliced off a little more for me.
B: Did you get fat?
A: No, but I did put on a few pounds.
B: That sounds like a dream job.
A: It was, until one day my manager caught me.
B: No more free cheese for you, huh?

A: I'm on a new diet.
B: What are you eating now?
A: I switched from pasta to potatoes.
B: Why did you do that?
A: Pasta is processed food. Potatoes are natural food.
B: Natural food has more vitamins.
A: And it's just as easy to prepare.
B: How do you prepare the potatoes?
A: I wash them, and then steam them for 15 minutes.
B: That's pretty simple.
A: Then I add butter, salt, and pepper.
B: Can I have all those cans of tomato sauce you bought for your pasta?

A: My girlfriend's mom got mad at me at the dinner table.
B: Why was that?
A: I sprinkled salt and pepper on the food before I tasted it.
B: What's the matter with that?
A: Her mom is a great cook.
B: So, a little salt and pepper never hurt anything.
A: It hurt her feelings.
B: Oh.
A: I apologized to her, but I could tell she was still upset.
B: Maybe you shouldn't eat there again.
A: I'm sure everything will be okay in a day or two.
B: It's your girlfriend's fault. She should have warned you.

A: I eat the same thing every day.
B: You're kidding.
A: No, I'm serious.
B: Doesn't that get old?
A: No, because I'm eating food that I like.
B: But the same thing day after day gets old.
A: Well, I guess if it ever does get old, I'll change to something different.
B: Do you eat fruits and vegetables every day?
A: No, I hate vegetables.
B: But you eat fruits.
A: I eat two apples, one banana, and one orange every day.
B: Well, there's nothing wrong with that.

A: There's something wrong with my orange.
B: What's wrong?
A: It's not orange!
B: Your orange isn't orange?
A: No, it's dark pink!
B: Are you sure? I never heard of such a thing.
A: I just peeled it, and I'm looking at it right now.
B: Let me see. Yes, you're right. Your orange is pink.
A: Who ever heard of such a thing?
B: Oh, look. Here's the little sticker that was on it. It's called a Pink Navel.
A: What is this world coming to?
B: Who knows? Maybe soon we'll have pink bananas.

A: I love peanuts.
B: Me, too. I love them roasted and salted.
A: I love boiled peanuts.
B: Boiled? I never heard of that.
A: Just boil raw peanuts in salt water until the shells are soft.
B: I'll have to try them sometime.
A: They're best when they're hot.
B: My brother is allergic to peanuts.
A: That's not good.
B: No, it isn't. He almost died when he was little.
A: I guess he has to be very careful about what he eats.
B: He has a very strict diet.

A: I'm gaining weight.
B: How much have you gained?
A: Three pounds just this month.
B: Do you know why?
A: I think it's the ice cream.
B: You started eating ice cream?
A: It was on sale.
B: How much did you buy?
A: I filled up my freezer with ice cream.
B: Well, it won't last forever.
A: No, I figure I'll finish it all by next week.
B: Then you can start losing weight, if there isn't another sale.

A: I'm stuffed.
B: Of course you are. You ate everything on the table.
A: I don't like to eat leftovers.
B: I'm glad to hear there's something you don't like to eat.
A: I like my food hot and fresh.
B: You like to see it disappear.
A: I don't like it reheated.
B: Well, you'll have hot fresh food tomorrow night.
A: I'm so full I'm going to burst.
B: You should loosen your belt.
A: I already loosened my belt and unbuttoned my pants.
B: Well, don't stand up, please.

A: I saw what you did.
B: I didn't do anything.
A: Oh yes, you did.
B: What are you talking about?
A: You know what I'm talking about.
B: I don't have any idea.
A: You know what you did.
B: Maybe I know, but how could you know?
A: Because I was watching you.
B: Okay, I'm sorry I did it.
A: Don't drink milk out of the carton. Use a glass!
B: I promise I'll never drink out of the carton again.

A: I have a stomachache.
B: Is it something you ate?
A: Maybe. I'm not sure.
B: What did you have for breakfast?
A: The usual, cereal with milk and a banana.
B: Maybe the milk was bad.
A: It didn't smell bad.
B: Maybe the banana was bad.
A: No, the banana was delicious.
B: Maybe you just need to go to the bathroom.
A: No, that's not the problem.
B: Maybe it will go away in a little while.

A: What's this stain?
B: I don't know.
A: It looks like blood.
B: I think my nose was bleeding.
A: You should wet your shirt immediately.
B: Why?
A: Because that gets the blood out of the shirt.
B: What's a little blood?
A: Your white shirt is ruined.
B: So, I'll just buy another one.
A: You can wear this one around the house.
B: Next time I'll soak it immediately.

A: My fingers hurt.
B: Why do they hurt?
A: I type too much.
B: You should take a break.
A: I need to type to make money.
B: But typing is causing you pain.
A: Maybe I should see a doctor.
B: Doctors are too expensive.
A: He might tell me to rest for a while.
B: He might want to cut you open.
A: He might say I'm okay.
B: He might say you have bone cancer.

A: What did the doctor say?
B: He thinks I have too much stress.
A: Stress causes your stomachaches?
B: Stress causes different problems with different people.
A: So what did he tell you to do?
B: He said I need to think positive.
A: He didn't give you any medication?
B: I hate medication. It makes me feel different.
A: So how do you think positive?
B: I think about nice things.
A: Like what?
B: Like a day at the beach, with my toes in the sand.

A: I cut my finger.
B: How did you do that?
A: It's a paper cut.
B: Paper can be dangerous.
A: It hurts, too.
B: Paper cuts can hurt a lot.
A: Where are the band-aids?
B: I think they're in the medicine cabinet.
A: It's on the tip of my finger.
B: A band-aid might not work.
A: I must not use this finger until the cut heals.
B: It might take a day or two to heal.

A: Do you smell that?
B: Oh, yes.
A: I can't stand cigarette smoke.
B: It smells so bad.
A: One cigarette stinks up the whole sidewalk.
B: Smokers think they are so cool.
A: They are so weak.
B: A little cigarette controls them.
A: They look so stupid taking a puff.
B: And then they blow smoke out of their mouth.
A: They think it's cool.
B: Cigarettes stink.

A: Do you have a cold?
B: Yes, I do.
A: How did you get it?
B: My sister had a cold. She gave it to me.
A: Have you taken anything for your cold?
B: No, I just blow my nose a lot.
A: Your nose is stopped up?
B: Yes. I have to breathe through my mouth.
A: Have you tried nose drops?
B: No, I don't like nose drops.
A: They work great.
B: I don't care. I don't like to put drops in my nose.

A: Would you put suntan lotion on my back, please?
B: Sure.
A: Thank you.
B: You shouldn't lie in the sun for too long.
A: I want to get a tan. I don't want to look so pale.
B: What's wrong with looking pale?
A: People think you might be sick.
B: Who thinks that?
A: I don't know.
B: It's better to be pale than to have skin cancer.
A: I know that.
B: So why are you arguing with me? Don't lie in the sun too long!

A: I can't quit smoking.
B: Of course you can.
A: I don't have enough will power.
B: Of course you do.
A: I wish I had never started.
B: So does every smoker.
A: I've tried to quit so many times.
B: So has everyone else.
A: Nothing seems to work.
B: All it takes is will power, and you have it.
A: Then why can't I quit?
B: You have to believe in yourself.

A: My back is killing me.
B: What did you do?
A: I got out of my car.
B: That's it?
A: I injured my back one time just by sneezing.
B: You should see a doctor.
A: My doctor said I need surgery.
B: So?
A: So, forget it.
B: You don't have the money?
A: I have no insurance.
B: Maybe a back rub would help.

A: My brother smokes three packs a day.
B: Three packs of what?
A: Cigarettes, of course.
B: How can he do that?
A: When he is almost finished with one cigarette, he uses it to light another.
B: He's a chain smoker.
A: He's been a chain smoker for 30 years.
B: That's unbelievable. Can he still breathe?
A: He can, but the people around him can't.
B: How can he still be alive?
A: His doctor says his heart and lungs are strong and healthy.
B: Maybe I should start smoking.

A: I hate brushing my teeth.
B: It's such a chore.
A: Brush, brush. Spit, spit.
B: What did they do in the old days?
A: They brushed with their fingers.
B: They also ate with their fingers!
A: Why do they call it the good old days?
B: Maybe because they didn't have to brush and floss.
A: Who invented flossing?
B: A dentist, I'm sure.
A: I hate flossing more than brushing!
B: I can't wait till all my teeth fall out.

A: Let's stop for a while. I need a break and some water.
B: This trail is hard to climb.
A: Especially on a hot day like this.
B: I can't believe we haven't seen any animals.
A: Thank goodness! I don't want to see any wild animals.
B: All we've seen so far is a couple of lizards.
A: We're hiking to lose weight, not to see goats and bears.
B: I bet I've lost a couple of pounds already.
A: All you've lost is some sweat.
B: I haven't even lost one pound of fat?
A: If you want to lose fat, you've got to do this hike every day.
B: Okay, but let's hike in town. At least there are cats and dogs to see.

A: Oh no, another pimple on my face.
B: Pimples suck.
A: It seems like I get a new pimple almost every day.
B: Maybe it's something in your diet.
A: No, I eat the same things day after day.
B: Then maybe it's in your genes.
A: You might be right.
B: Do pimples run in your family?
A: Not that I've noticed.
B: Well, maybe it's from the pollution in the air.
A: Whatever the cause, I hate seeing them on my face.
B: Well, on the bright side, they're fun to pop.

A: Do you believe everything you hear?
B: I don't believe anything I don't see with my own eyes.
A: You can't believe what you hear on TV or radio.
B: You can't believe what you read in the newspapers.
A: Everyone tells you a different story about the same thing.
B: Three different people will give you three different stories.
A: And the government will give you a fourth story.
B: Yes, like the government says not to worry about the swine flu.
A: But the swine flu just killed 20 people in Mexico.
B: The government says we have nothing to worry about.
A: Then why are some schools telling the kids to stay home?
B: The government says to wash our hands frequently, and we'll all be okay.

A: Don't pick your nose.
B: I wasn't picking my nose.
A: What were you doing?
B: I was scratching my nose.
A: I think I know the difference between picking and scratching.
B: Okay, mom, maybe I was picking it a little bit.
A: Use a tissue next time.
B: I didn't have a tissue.
A: Then wait till you find a tissue.
B: I couldn't wait. It was an emergency.
A: Oh, really? Maybe you should have called 911.
B: It wasn't that kind of emergency.

A: Our TV remote is filthy.
B: Yes, it's covered with crud.
A: I'm going to clean it.
B: Don't use water on it!
A: I'll use a damp cloth.
B: Don't let water get into any of the cracks.
A: I'll squeeze the cloth so it's almost dry.
B: Don't rub the numbers off the remote.
A: I will rub gently but firmly.
B: Do it quickly, please, so I can change channels during commercials.
A: I'll give it back to you in a couple of minutes.
B: Maybe we should put it in a plastic bag to keep it clean.

A: My ear is killing me.
B: What's the matter?
A: I was on a plane.
B: So?
A: So, every time the plane goes up, my ear starts to hurt.
B: That's no good.
A: Sometimes the pain goes away, and sometimes it doesn't.
B: Have you seen a doctor?
A: I've been to two doctors.
B: And they couldn't fix your problem?
A: They both said I have to live with it.
B: Or you can stay off planes.

A: Did you see the woman with the new face?
B: Did she get a nice job?
A: She got an "everything" job!
B: What do you mean?
A: A team of doctors gave her a whole new face.
B: Why did they do that?
A: A mad dog bit most of her face off.
B: Oh, that's terrible. What does she look like now?
A: Her face is really fat, but they say the swelling will go down.
B: And then will she look normal again?
A: I guess so.
B: God bless modern medicine.

A: There's something wrong with my right hand.
B: What's wrong with it?
A: It aches most of the time.
B: What do you think it is?
A: I don't know. I think it's old age.
B: If it's old age, why don't both of your hands hurt?
A: That's a good question. Maybe it's not old age.
B: Are you right-handed?
A: Yes. All my life.
B: You're wearing out your right hand. Stop using it so much.
A: But I do all my writing with my right hand.
B: Start typing instead. That way your left hand will do half the work.

A: I really like this house.
B: Can we afford it?
A: They want 20 percent down.
B: That's a lot of money.
A: But the house is so nice.
B: It's in a great neighborhood.
A: It's close to the beach.
B: It's close to the freeways.
A: It's got a big yard.
B: The kids love the house, too.
A: If we don't buy it, someone else will.
B: You're right. Let's buy it now. We can worry later.

A: We can't afford this house.
B: Are you sure?
A: We will be house rich, but cash poor.
B: What do you mean?
A: Our monthly payments will be too high.
B: We won't have any money for other things?
A: No, we won't have money for gas or food.
B: We'll be eating peanut butter sandwiches?
A: Without the peanut butter!
B: That's no good!
A: We have to find a cheaper house.
B: Of course. We can't live without gas or peanut butter.

A: That is a beautiful house.
B: I don't like it.
A: What's the matter with it?
B: It's on the corner.
A: So?
B: That means it gets twice as much traffic.
A: You're right.
B: When you're inside, you will always hear cars stopping and stopping at the intersection.
A: Or you'll hear the collision if someone doesn't stop.
B: Or you'll see the collision if they crash into the house.
A: Let's find a house that's at the end of a dead end.
B: That's perfect. The less traffic, the better.

A: I hate looking for an apartment.
B: Me, too.
A: We have a 2 o'clock appointment to see the one on Main Street.
B: We'd better get ready to go.
A: It's an upstairs unit.
B: That's good, because I don't want to live under people with loud feet.
A: And it's a corner unit.
B: That's great. We won't have neighbors on both sides of us.
A: No pets are allowed.
B: Perfect. We don't have to listen to barking dogs.
A: And there are only six units in the whole building.
B: Where's the checkbook? I'm ready to rent it without even seeing it.

A: Did you call the manager?
B: Yes. He said he'd come over tomorrow.
A: Did he say what time?
B: Yes. He said he'd be here at 9 o'clock.
A: Did he understand what the problem is?
B: Yes. I told him our doorbell doesn't work.
A: It shouldn't take him long to fix it.
B: I don't even know why we need to fix it.
A: In case we have visitors.
B: But they can just knock on the door.
A: Actually, I want him to look at our carpet, too.
B: Yes, it would be nice if he'd give us a new carpet.

A: Do you like this house?
B: Yes, it's beautiful.
A: It's perfect for us and the kids.
B: Three bedrooms, three bathrooms, and a big back yard.
A: And we can afford it!
B: So are we going to buy it?
A: I'm afraid not.
B: It's too far from your job, isn't it?
A: I can't spend four hours on the road every day.
B: By the time you get home, you'll be too tired to even eat.
A: I won't be able to play with the kids.
B: No, we have to find something closer to your job.

A: Boy, it's chilly outside, isn't it?
B: It sure is.
A: In fact, it's chilly in the apartment, too.
B: Let's turn on the heat.
A: I'll check to make sure that all the windows are shut.
B: It should be warmer in a few minutes.
A: It's so nice to have a heated apartment.
B: How did they survive in the old days?
A: They had fireplaces.
B: Someone had to chop the wood.
A: And carry it into the house.
B: All we have to do is flip a switch.

A: This is a nice neighborhood.
B: The streets are clean and quiet.
A: The neighbors don't party on the weekends.
B: People take care of their lawns.
A: No rusty old cars are sitting in the front yards.
B: We never have to call the police about anything.
A: Our kids are completely safe.
B: So why are we selling our house?
A: They're building a 3-story apartment building on the corner.
B: So we've got to sell before property values go down?
A: Yes. I still can't believe our city council allowed this building.
B: They're probably getting something under the table.

A: That was a huge fire in Santa Barbara.
B: Yes, it was.
A: They said about 30 houses burned to the ground.
B: And they were expensive houses.
A: I feel so sorry for those people.
B: Why feel sorry for rich people?
A: I feel sorry for anyone who loses their home.
B: So do I, but not if they're rich.
A: What does that have to do with it?
B: Rich people think they're better than us.
A: How many rich people do you know?
B: None.

A: Bears are invading our neighborhoods.
B: Of course they are. They're starving to death.
A: They should stay in the woods where they belong.
B: There's no food in the woods.
A: Can't they eat grass?
B: Do you think a bear is a cow?
A: Well, I've seen them eating berries.
B: Berries aren't in season all year round.
A: It's too dangerous for kids and pets.
B: People need to cover their trash cans.
A: The police need to shoot all the bears.
B: You don't solve a problem by shooting it.

A: I need a job.
B: I thought you had a job.
A: I did.
B: What happened?
A: I got laid off.
B: That's terrible! When did it happen?
A: I got laid off last week.
B: Just you?
A: No, ten of my coworkers got laid off, too.
B: What are you going to do?
A: I'm looking in the newspaper for a job.
B: Good luck!

A: Before you go to that interview, check yourself.
B: What's to check?
A: Are your nails clean?
B: Yes, they are.
A: Did you double-check your nose and teeth?
B: They are clean, too.
A: Did you shine your shoes?
B: My shoes are shined.
A: Do your socks match?
B: Of course they match.
A: No, they don't. One is black and one is dark blue.
B: Yikes! Thank you.

A: Life is hard.
B: It sure is.
A: I thought school was hard.
B: Me, too. I couldn't wait to graduate.
A: But now work is hard, too.
B: I agree. Work is just as hard as school.
A: Sometimes I wish I was back in school.
B: Me, too. School was fun.
A: And it was only 12 years.
B: It went by pretty fast.
A: But work goes on forever!
B: We have to work for 30 years!

A: I'm sleepy.
B: So am I.
A: I had a long day.
B: So did I.
A: I didn't even have lunch.
B: Neither did I.
A: I was busy the whole day.
B: So was I.
A: I had to bring work home with me.
B: I did too.
A: Your day was just like mine.
B: Of course it was. We work together!

A: I don't like my job.
B: What do you do?
A: I'm a babysitter.
B: Is that a lot of work?
A: Babies cry all the time.
B: You have to change their diapers.
A: I have to feed them.
B: Are you looking for another job?
A: No, I'm looking for another family.
B: Another family?
A: A family with only one baby.
B: That's a good idea.

A: I need a job.
B: What was your last job?
A: I was a painter.
B: What happened?
A: I got laid off because there was no work.
B: What else can you do?
A: I'm a handyman.
B: Can you fix a dripping faucet in a kitchen sink?
A: Of course.
B: Then I have a job for you in my kitchen.
A: It will cost you only $20 plus parts.
B: Okay. That sounds like a fair price.

A: What would you do if you lost your job?
B: I have no idea. I've been here for 20 years.
A: Do you have any other skills?
B: Well, I know how to flip hamburgers.
A: No one would hire you to flip hamburgers.
B: Have you heard something that you're not telling me?
A: What do you mean?
B: Are there going to be layoffs at this place?
A: I certainly hope not!
B: If you got laid off, you'd be flipping hamburgers, too.
A: Oh great, we could both work at Burger King.
B: Maybe we'd get laid off there, too.

A: Do your students ever talk about their jobs?
B: Yes, and they ask me what jobs are the best.
A: I tell my students to become a teacher.
B: Teaching is a great job.
A: It's the best job I've ever had.
B: What makes it so good?
A: For me, it's the students.
B: What do you mean?
A: I mean I have wonderful students.
B: That must be nice.
A: Teaching is the best part of my whole day.
B: You're a lucky man to have a job you love.

A: Boy, I'm glad that job is finished.
B: How long did it take?
A: Four hours, without a break.
B: It's always nice to finish a job.
A: Well, it's good and bad.
B: What's bad about it?
A: When you finish, all you do is start another job!
B: Yes, that's right. It does get boring.
A: Especially if it's the same work, over and over.
B: But that's what most people do.
A: Yes, I guess most of us are stuck in a routine.
B: I wonder if there is any job that you don't repeat over and over.

A: I think I have the worst boss in the world.
B: What makes him so bad?
A: He's rude and he yells a lot.
B: That's hard to take.
A: I've never heard him say please or thank you.
B: He sounds like a real jerk.
A: No one at work likes him.
B: Can't you report him to his supervisor?
A: Of course not. If I do that, I'll lose my job.
B: Yes, they don't like troublemakers or complainers.
A: I can't quit, because I'm making a good salary.
B: You shouldn't choose money over happiness.

A: What are we going to do?
B: About what?
A: About finding a job for me.
B: You don't need a job. I make enough money for both of us.
A: That doesn't matter. I don't want to sit around.
B: Okay, what kind of job do you want?
A: I'm not sure.
B: Well, you should do something that you enjoy.
A: I enjoy selling. I was born to sell.
B: Okay, what do you want to sell?
A: Cigarette lighters. I'll make a fortune.
B: But you hate cigarettes and you hate smoking!

A: A new hotel is looking for workers.
B: Yes, I saw it on the TV news.
A: They need 300 new workers.
B: And 4,000 people showed up.
A: So many people are out of work.
B: I still have my job, thank goodness.
A: So do I, but I'm worried.
B: Me too. There are no guarantees.
A: If you lose your job, you can move in with me.
B: Oh, thank you. That's very nice of you.
A: You would do the same for me.
B: Of course. What are friends for?

A: I think I did something real stupid.
B: What did you do?
A: I bought some stock.
B: Everybody buys stock.
A: I bought it on a hunch.
B: You didn't read about the company first?
A: I didn't have to. It's been in business for 60 years.
B: So what's the problem?
A: I used all my savings on this one company.
B: You put all your eggs into one basket.
A: If the company goes out of business, I'll have nothing.
B: Oh, you'll have something\x97you'll have a lesson you'll never forget!

A: I was going to be a doctor.
B: What happened to your plans?
A: I got a D in college chemistry.
B: Well, a D is better than an F.
A: A tutor helped me get the D!
B: So, you didn't become a doctor.
A: And now I'm glad that I didn't.
B: Why's that?
A: A hospital is the most dangerous place in the world.
B: Oh, yes, because of all the killer germs.
A: If you're a smart doctor, you stay away from hospitals.
B: Yes, the smart doctors are those TV news doctors\x97no hospitals, no patients.

A: I want to be a mail carrier when I grow up.
B: Why?
A: Because you get to meet a lot of people.
B: You sure do.
A: And you get a lot of exercise every day.
B: That's the truth.
A: And you get to play with a lot of dogs.
B: Well, you're supposed to be working.
A: Yes, but I will always pet the friendly dogs.
B: What about the unfriendly dogs?
A: I think if you are friendly to dogs, they are friendly to you.
B: Dogs are like people\x97not all of them are friendly.

A: I want to move to New York.
B: To the state or the city?
A: To the city, of course.
B: Why do you want to move there?
A: Because I want to make a lot of money.
B: There are a lot of poor people in New York.
A: There sure are\x97at least a million.
B: So how do you plan to become rich?
A: I will knock on the doors of all the corporations.
B: That won't make you rich. Nobody will talk to you.
A: I will keep knocking on doors.
B: All you will get is sore knuckles.

A: Let's go out to eat.
B: That sounds like fun.
A: Where do you want to go?
B: Let me think a minute.
A: I feel like Chinese.
B: That sounds delicious.
A: I know a good Chinese restaurant.
B: How far away is it?
A: It's only 10 minutes from here.
B: Do we need reservations?
A: Oh, no. We can walk right in.
B: Let's go now. I'm hungry!

A: I can't believe how long this line is.
B: This is a popular restaurant, isn't it?
A: Yes, but it isn't a fast-food restaurant, is it?
B: It's the slowest hamburger in town.
A: That's because they cook it while you wait.
B: Yes. That's why it's also the best hamburger in town.
A: A great burger and great service.
B: Yes, the workers are very polite.
A: And they're clean.
B: I've been coming here for years.
A: Me too.
B: Excuse me. They just called my number.

A: Lunch was delicious.
B: Thank you.
A: What kind of soup was that?
B: It was tomato soup.
A: That tasted so good.
B: I put lemon and butter in it.
A: The sandwich was good, too.
B: Everyone likes bacon and tomato sandwiches.
A: Especially on toast.
B: And the pickles were great, too.
A: Tomorrow we'll have rice and fish for lunch.
B: I can't wait.

A: I'm calling the waiter.
B: What's the matter?
A: This steak has too much fat.
B: What do you want the waiter to do?
A: Bring me a better steak.
B: I wouldn't do that.
A: Why not?
B: They will drop the new steak on the floor, step on it, and then spit on it.
A: You're crazy.
B: Then the waiter will give you a big smile as he brings you the new steak.
A: Where do you get these crazy ideas?
B: I used to cook in a restaurant!

A: Let's leave.
B: But we just got here.
A: Did you see the waiter's hands?
B: No.
A: He had dirty fingernails.
B: Really?
A: His nails were black!
B: That's disgusting.
A: And he poured water into our glasses.
B: Yuck! No water for me.
A: I wonder if the cooks' nails are dirty, too.
B: Who cares? Let's get out of here.

A: This hot bread is delicious.
B: I like this restaurant because they give you free bread.
A: Well, I think we are paying for it.
B: No. Look at the bill when we get it. There's no charge for the bread.
A: It is delicious, especially with butter.
B: I think we should just leave after we fill up on the bread.
A: They probably wouldn't like that.
B: I'm eating so much bread that I'm getting full.
A: Then stop eating the bread!
B: Okay, just one more piece. Pass the butter, please.
A: If I owned a restaurant, I would never serve hot bread before the main course.
B: That's terrible. I would never go to your restaurant.

A: Is this a clean restaurant?
B: Well, the tables and chairs look okay.
A: Okay, let's sit down.
B: Check out the silverware.
A: It passes inspection.
B: Here comes the waiter. See if his hands and nails are clean.
A: Well, the waiter looked clean, so I guess it's okay to eat here.
B: You're forgetting about the bathroom.
A: I'm going to just hope that the bathroom is clean.
B: You're not going to examine it before we order dinner?
A: No, I'd rather not find out that it's dirty, because I'm pretty hungry right now.
B: Me, too. Let's forget about germs and focus on food.

A: Have you seen our waiter?
B: Here he comes now.
A: We've been sitting here for almost 10 minutes.
B: Oops, I guess I was wrong. That isn't our waiter.
A: We can give him five more minutes, and then leave.
B: I'll go up front and talk to the manager.
A: That's a good idea.
B: Maybe they'll give us free drinks for waiting so long.
A: Maybe he'll send us our waiter immediately.
B: Every time we eat out, it's an adventure.
A: Last time, we got seats next to the kitchen.
B: We'll never go there again.

A: Is this table okay?
B: No, it's too close to the kitchen door. 
A: How about this table?
B: No, it's too close to the front door.
A: This looks like a nice table.
B: No, it's too close to the salad bar. 
A: Okay, I give up.
B: Well, there is one good table.
A: Great. Which one?
B: That one. A group of eight just sat down at it.

A: I don't believe the art world.
B: What is it this time?
A: An Andy Warhol drawing.
B: He's a famous artist.
A: He drew two butterflies and a flower on a napkin in a restaurant.
B: Did he sign it?
A: Yes.
B: Is it beautiful?
A: It's just black ink on a white napkin. And the napkin has food stains!
B: So it's not worth much?
A: Only about $30,000.
B: Without the food stains, it would probably be worth more.

A: Why is there so much crime?
B: Because parents don't teach their kids right from wrong.
A: Is that it?
B: Also, there aren't enough police.
A: But there are a lot of police.
B: There's only one police officer per 100 criminals.
A: Can't we hire more police?
B: No. It costs too much money.
A: Doesn't crime cost more than police?
B: Yes, it does.
A: So it would be cheaper to hire more police?
B: Yes, it would.

A: This is a great neighborhood.
B: Yes, it is.
A: People are friendly.
B: Yes, they are.
A: The streets and sidewalks are clean.
B: Yes, they are.
A: There's a real nice park nearby.
B: Yes, there is.
A: I feel safe here.
B: There is no crime here.
A: I wish I could move here.
B: Maybe you can, if someone moves out.

A: The house burned down.
B: What happened?
A: The man fell asleep.
B: Was he smoking?
A: Yes, he was smoking a cigarette.
B: Did he die?
A: Yes, he did. His cat died, too.
B: That's too bad. What about his smoke alarm?
A: The battery was dead.
B: A good battery would have saved his life.
A: He had cigarettes, but no battery.
B: It happens all the time.

A: They say he has started fifteen big fires.
B: He's been in jail three times already.
A: Why did they ever let him out?
B: It's the law. They can't keep him in jail forever.
A: Why not? Everyone knows he's a firebug. He loves to start fires.
B: I don't know. Sometimes the law doesn't make sense.
A: But his latest fire killed someone.
B: This time they have charged him with murder.
A: So maybe he'll go to jail forever?
B: I sure hope so.
A: Someone should set him on fire.
B: That would teach him a good lesson.

A: Put your seatbelt on.
B: Why?
A: Because it will protect you in case of an accident.
B: But it's uncomfortable.
A: It's the law.
B: It's so much trouble.
A: It's common sense.
B: It's so tight that it's hard for me to breathe.
A: Hold your breath till we get there.
B: Okay, my seatbelt is on.
A: I'm glad you don't complain very much.
B: I'm ready for an accident.

A: What are you doing?
B: I'm going to change the light bulb. It burnt out.
A: What are you standing on?
B: A couple of dictionaries and some textbooks.
A: Are you crazy?
B: What's the matter?
A: Those books will slip and you'll fall.
B: It's only a couple of feet.
A: What if you fall while you're holding the light bulb, and it breaks and pieces go into your eyes?
B: I never thought about that.
A: You'd be blind for the rest of your life!
B: I'll get the stepladder.

A: Did you see that puddle of water on the floor?
B: Yes. I called for a clean-up.
A: A puddle of water is very dangerous.
B: It isn't easy to see.
A: But it's real easy to slip on.
B: Especially on these slick floors.
A: Someone who slips could hurt their back.
B: They could even crack their head open.
A: We should stand here till the clean-up person gets here.
B: We can leave if we put an orange cone here.
A: Yes, but I don't know where the orange cones are.
B:  It doesn't matter. Here he comes now with the mop.

A: What happens when the fire alarm rings?
B: We tell our students to leave the classroom.
A: Can they take their belongings?
B: Yes, if they do it quickly.
A: Where do the students go?
B: They go out to the north parking lot.
A: What do the teachers do?
B: We take our rosters to the parking lot and take roll.
A: Why do you do that?
B: We want to make sure all the students are out of the building.
A: If they are all outside, then what?
B: Then we just wait outside for a fireman to tell us to go back in.

A: I have to go back upstairs.
B: Why? We're already late.
A: I have to check the stove.
B: What's the matter?
A: Maybe I left the burner on.
B: No, you didn't. I checked the stove before we left.
A: Are you sure?
B: Of course I'm sure.
A: Well, I have to go back upstairs anyway.
B: It's getting later every minute.
A: I think I left the water running.
B: No, you didn't. Let's go! The only thing running is the clock!

A: The city is buying guns.
B: What are they paying?
A: Up to $200 for each gun, no questions asked.
B: Why are they doing this?
A: They want to get guns off the street.
B: Who would turn in a gun for $200?
A: That isn't a good deal?
B: A good gun costs $400 or more.
A: Well, if you bring your receipt, maybe they'll give you $400.
B: I'll keep my receipt and my gun.
A: I didn't know you had a gun.
B: Everyone in America should have a gun.

A: You're yawning.
B: I sure am.
A: You should go to bed.
B: I will as soon as I finish this article.
A: What are you reading?
B: It's about crime in Los Angeles.
A: What does it say?
B: The mayor says the crime rate is going down.
A: Then why does everyone lock their doors?
B: I guess they haven't read this article.
A: No one believes that the crime rate is going down.
B: Maybe the mayor is just talking about his own neighborhood.

A: People who live in California are crazy.
B: Why is that?
A: Because of all the earthquakes and fires.
B: But big earthquakes happen only once in a while.
A: Once in a while is once too many.
B: But you're right. There are a lot of fires.
A: A recent fire destroyed 85 homes.
B: Still, it's safer than Florida.
A: Florida doesn't have earthquakes or fires.
B: No, Florida just has hurricanes every year from June to October.
A: But most of those hurricanes are harmless.
B: Excuse me. Hurricane Andrew destroyed 30,000 homes!

A: Do you go to college?
B: Yes, I do.
A: What college do you go to?
B: I go to Pasadena City College.
A: Do you like it?
B: Oh, yes, I really like it.
A: Why do you like it?
B: Because it has great teachers.
A: What else?
B: I like all my classmates, too.
A: Anything else?
B: Yes. It's not expensive!

A: I lost my new pen.
B: Where did you lose it?
A: I don't know.
B: When did you lose it?
A: I think I lost it today. I used it yesterday.
B: Did you check all your pockets?
A: I checked all my pockets.
B: Did you look in your desk?
A: Yes. It isn't there, either.
B: It's probably around somewhere.
A: Oh, well, it only cost me a dollar.
B: Only a dollar? Don't even look for it.

A: Gravity is very important.
B: What is gravity?
A: It's the force that pulls everything down.
B: I don't understand.
A: If you pour water into a glass, the water goes down into the glass.
B: Of course it does.
A: Without gravity, the water would go up.
B: You're joking.
A: Without gravity, you would go up.
B: What do you mean?
A: You would float into the sky like a balloon.
B: That would be fun!

A: I can't read my book.
B: Turn on the light.
A: The light is on.
B: Open the book.
A: The book is open.
B: See an eye doctor.
A: That's what I need to do.
B: He'll give you a prescription for glasses.
A: I'll make an appointment tomorrow.
B: I'll get the yellow pages for an eye doctor.
A: Read the phone number to me.
B: I'll read it very loud, in case your hearing is getting bad, too.

A: What do you need for school?
B: I need pencils.
A: Anything else?
B: I need a notebook.
A: Do you need a pen?
B: No. I already have a pen.
A: Do you need a calculator?
B: No. The teacher doesn't permit calculators.
A: How about a dictionary?
B: No, we have a big dictionary in the classroom.
A: Well, I guess that's it.
B: Yes, that's all I need for now.

A: I like this magazine.
B: So do I.
A: I read it once, and I subscribed.
B: It gives you all the news.
A: All the news in only 50 pages.
B: I like the political cartoons.
A: I like the beautiful photos of the houses for sale.
B: I always read the film reviews.
A: I never miss the food and drink section.
B: I gave a subscription to my parents.
A: Me too. They canceled their other news magazines.
B: So did mine!

A: My pen is out of ink.
B: Shake it a couple of times.
A: I shook it. There is no more ink.
B: You can borrow mine.
A: Thank you. I'll buy a new one tomorrow.
B: What were you doing?
A: I was writing a letter.
B: Who were you writing to?
A: It's to my mom.
B: Tell her I said hello.
A: Okay. I'll return your pen when I'm done.
B: Take your time.

A: Have you done your homework?
B: Not yet.
A: Then why are you watching TV?
B: This is my favorite show.
A: Go do your homework.
B: But, mom!
A: You can watch TV after you do your homework.
B: But the show will be over.
A: There will be another show next week.
B: Please?
A: You know the rules.
B: I hate the rules! I can't wait till I grow up.

A: I can't wait until I graduate.
B: Me too.
A: No more homework.
B: I hate homework.
A: Are you going to college?
B: I can't afford it.
A: Me neither.
B: So what are you going to do?
A: I'm joining the army.
B: You're kidding. You might get killed.
A: I don't think so. After I finish, I'll have enough money to go to college.
B: That's not a bad idea.

A: What is your major?
B: English.
A: What are you going to do with an English major?
B: I'm going to be a teacher.
A: High school or middle school?
B: High school.
A: I teach high school English.
B: I didn't know that.
A: I started teaching five years ago.
B: How do you like it?
A: Do you see all this gray hair? It was totally black five years ago.
B: Maybe I'll teach middle school.

A: Parking at school is impossible.
B: I'll say.
A: I drove around for half an hour.
B: Did you find a spot?
A: I found a spot, but someone cut in and took it from me.
B: Did you yell at them?
A: Yes, I did.
B: And?
A: And he yelled back at me.
B: How rude.
A: But I got lucky a few minutes later.
B: You have to be lucky to find a parking space.

A: This is a huge library.
B: Yes, it has lots of rooms and lots of space.
A: And lots of books.
B: And lots of thieves.
A: What do you mean?
B: I mean, keep your belongings close to you.
A: The only thing in my backpack is used books.
B: But thieves don't know that.
A: They might think that I've got an iPod or laptop in there.
B: Now you're thinking.
A: You'd think a library would be safe from thieves.
B: Not even a church is safe from thieves.

A: How good is your math?
B: I can add two and two.
A: So you're not very good at math?
B: I'm terrible at math.
A: Well, I need some help.
B: With what?
A: I'm taking a math course in school.
B: Well, you should ask your teacher or your classmates for help.
A: I can't do that.
B: Why not?
A: They might think I'm stupid.
B: They're not going to think that! They'll be glad to help you.

A: Do you believe in God?
B: Of course.
A: Do you pray to God?
B: Occasionally.
A: When's that?
B: When I need something.
A: Like what?
B: Well, if I have a big test at school.
A: Does God answer your prayers?
B: Yes, I've passed all my tests.
A: Do you ever pray for money?
B: Not yet. I won't need to do that until I graduate from high school.

A: The cops finally found the husband.
B: What husband?
A: The husband of the driver who ran over two college students at 3 a.m.
B: Oh, yeah. The girl died instantly, and the boy is still in the hospital.
A: The husband said he tried to help the boy.
B: Yes, he pushed him off the hood of the car.
A: No, he said he gently placed the boy on the street.
B: So what? They still drove off.
A: The husband said a fire department was nearby.
B: So what? Did he dial 911?
A: He said he was thinking about it, but he didn't get around to it.
B: He didn't get around to turning himself in, either.

A: I like that shirt.
B: So do I.
A: How much is it?
B: I don't know. The tag is missing.
A: Ask the clerk.
B: I will.
A: Oh, look. Here's another shirt just like it.
B: Does it have a price tag?
A: Yes, it does. It's only $20.
B: That's a great price.
A: I think I'll buy both of them.
B: You'd better try them on first.

A: I bought you a pair of pants.
B: Thank you.
A: I hope they fit.
B: I hope you kept the receipt.
A: You think they won't fit?
B: I think I've put on some weight.
A: You think?
B: Maybe a pound or two.
A: Maybe four or five pounds?
B: My waist is bigger than it was.
A: No problem. These pants have an elastic waistband.
B: You are so smart!

A: What do we need to buy?
B: Let me look at our list.
A: I know that we need milk.
B: Nonfat.
A: Of course. What else?
B: We need cheese, bread, and ham.
A: What kind of cheese?
B: Swiss.
A: Of course, the cheese with holes in it.
B: I never used to buy Swiss cheese.
A: Why not?
B: I didn't want to pay for the holes.

A: I need some pants.
B: I thought you just bought a pair.
A: I did.
B: What's wrong with them so soon?
A: The pants are fine, but the pocket has a huge hole in it.
B: You shouldn't carry your keys and pens in your pocket.
A: But that's what pockets are for.
B: You should carry them in a purse.
A: I'm a man, and men don't carry purses!
B: Well, you should buy pants with stronger pockets.
A: I would if I could find someone who makes strong pockets.
B: Try a Google search online.

A: What are those wipes for?
B: You use them to wipe the handle of the shopping cart.
A: That's a great idea.
B: Yes, all the markets just started offering wipes to shoppers.
A: I'm going to take five wipes.
B: What do you need five of them for?
A: One to wipe the handle, and the others to wipe the produce.
B: What's the matter with the produce?
A: Do you think the bananas fell from the sky?
B: What do you mean?
A: I mean, someone used their dirty hands to pick the bananas, the apples, and the oranges.
B: Well, you better save a wipe for the dirty dollar bills you're going to pay with.

A: Did you go to the 99 Cents store?
B: Yes, I did.
A: What did you buy?
B: Well, I got a lot of good deals, as usual.
A: Like what?
B: Well, a dozen large eggs were only 99 cents.
A: That's a good deal.
B: And a one-pound tub of soft butter was the same price.
A: Another good deal.
B: But the best deal was five pounds of potatoes for 99 cents.
A: I don't know how that store makes money.
B: Neither do I, but they're doing something right.

A: I need a new computer.
B: What's the matter with yours?
A: It's six years old.
B: That's pretty old.
A: It still works, but I'm going to give it to a charity.
B: Are you going to buy a desktop or laptop?
A: Oh, a laptop, of course.
B: A PC or a Mac?
A: I haven't decided yet.
B: More and more people are using Macs.
A: But 90 percent of the world uses PCs.
B: And that's not going to change anytime soon.

A: I got ripped off.
B: What happened?
A: I had a car problem, so I went online.
B: Did you find a solution?
A: Yes, I did. A site I went to said they would send me the solution.
B: So, what's the problem?
A: I sent them $20 using my credit card, but they never sent me the solution.
B: What are you going to do?
A: I sent them an email asking for my money back.
B: Have you heard from them?
A: Not yet. It's been a week.
B: Well, I guess that's a $20 lesson for you.

A: Where's the pencil sharpener?
B: Which one?
A: Any one. I need to sharpen this pencil.
B: I think there's one on the dining room table.
A: I already looked there.
B: Did you look in the desk drawer?
A: Yes, I looked there, too.
B: Don't we have about five sharpeners?
A: Yes, but they seem to have legs.
B: Tomorrow I'm going to buy an electric sharpener.
A: Get one with the rubber suction cups on the bottom.
B: Yes. That way it will stay where I put it.

A: I'm trying to stretch my dollars.
B: How are you doing that?
A: I started shopping at the dollar store.
B: That saves a lot of money.
A: I bought three pounds of potatoes for a dollar.
B: That's a good deal.
A: Yes, even though some of the potatoes had eyes.
B: Just put them in the fridge.
A: Also, I bought a can of cheap coffee and a bag of good coffee.
B: Why did you do that?
A: I mixed them together.
B: If the coffee still tastes okay, that's a good idea.

A: Can we go to the baseball game?
B: Of course.
A: I love baseball.
B: So do I.
A: I love to eat the peanuts.
B: I love to eat the hot dogs.
A: I hope we\x92ll see a home run.
B: I hope we\x92ll catch a foul ball.
A: Bring a jacket.
B: Yes. It gets a little cool at night.
A: Bring a glove to catch a foul ball.
B: No. I\x92ll just use my cap to catch a foul ball.

A: Golf is a silly game.
B: It certainly is.
A: You hit a white ball.
B: And then you chase it.
A: And then you hit it again.
B: Finally, you put the ball into a hole in the ground.
A: You do this 18 times, because there are 18 holes. 
B: What\x92s the point?
A: How can it be fun?
B: They pay money to play this silly game!
A: I think golfers have a mental problem.
B: I think they\x92re nuts.

A: Do you want to go fishing?
B: Yes. That\x92s a good idea.
A: Where do you want to go?
B: We can go to the river.
A: Or we can go to the lake.
B: Or we can go to the ocean.
A: Let\x92s go to the lake.
B: Yes. The lake is only 10 miles away.
A: We can be there in 20 minutes.
B: I\x92ll get our fishing rods.
A: I\x92ll get the bait.
B: We\x92ll have fresh fish for dinner!

A: Baseball is fun.
B: I like to hit the ball.
A: I like to run around the bases.
B: I like to slide into the bases.
A: Yeah. It\x92s a lot of fun to slide.
B: I want to be a baseball player when I grow up.
A: Me too. I want to play for the Yankees.
B: Not me. I want to play for the Dodgers.
A: We have to practice every day.
B: I don\x92t like practice.
A: Me neither. It\x92s boring.
B: But practice makes perfect.

A: Let\x92s go jogging.
B: That\x92s a good idea.
A: I bought some new shoes.
B: Are they comfortable?
A: They\x92re very comfortable.
B: How much were they?
A: They were on sale for $80.
B: Do they help you run faster?
A: No, but my feet don\x92t hurt anymore.
B: Then they\x92re worth every penny.
A: You might want to buy a pair.
B: I\x92ll wait until I wear this pair out.

A: Tiger is the greatest golfer in the world.
B: You can say that again.
A: But I\x92m worried about Tiger.
B: Why is that?
A: Because he likes to SCUBA dive.
B: What\x92s wrong with that?
A: It can be dangerous.
B: You mean he could drown.
A: He shouldn\x92t SCUBA dive until he retires.
B: But he dives to relax.
A: He might relax, but it makes me nervous.
B: If his wife doesn\x92t mind, you shouldn\x92t mind.

A: Did you watch that golf tournament?
B: The one that Tiger won?
A: How did he do it?
B: It was nothing for him.
A: He sank a 20-foot putt on the last hole to win by one stroke!
B: He sank a 25-footer last year at the same tournament to win by one stroke.
A: I think he is from outer space.
B: No human could possibly play golf that well.
A: Whenever he needs a shot to win a tournament, he makes that shot.
B: No human can do that.
A: Somebody should check his birth record.
B: I bet it says he was born on Mars.

A: Who\x92s the greatest baseball player?
B: There are so many great players.
A: Yes, but who is the greatest?
B: I\x92d have to say Babe Ruth.
A: Most people would say that.
B: He changed the game.
A: Yes, he made the home run popular.
B: Everybody loved him, all over the nation.
A: He helped make the Yankees the best team ever.
B: And Ruth was a good person, too.
A: He always visited hospitals to cheer up sick kids.
B: There will never be another Babe.

A: Did you hear what happened at the baseball game?
B: No, please tell me.
A: Someone punched out someone.
B: That\x92s not nice.
A: It\x92s worse than that.
B: How so?
A: Two guys got into an argument.
B: I\x92ll bet they were drinking.
A: A third guy punched one of the two guys.
B: I\x92ll bet he was drinking, too.
A: The victim hit his head on the concrete steps and died.
B: That\x92s terrible. Can\x92t people just have fun at a baseball game?

A: I want to go to the ball game.
B: Is there a game tonight?
A: Yes, it starts at 7 p.m.
B: Can we get tickets?
A: Yes, but only the cheap tickets.
B: How much are they?
A: They\x92re only $5 each.
B: That\x92s a good price.
A: Yes, it\x92s cheaper than a hot dog or a beer.
B: Where are the seats?
A: They\x92re behind the outfield.
B: Maybe we can catch a home run ball.

A: Golf is so hard.
B: What's so hard about hitting a little white ball?
A: It's hard if you want to do it right.
B: You mean like Tiger?
A: No, like a good amateur golfer.
B: What's so hard about golf?
A: There are so many things you have to do right.
B: Like what?
A: Like keep your left arm straight, keep your head down, and follow through.
B: Yikes! Who can remember all that?
A: You need to get a lot of lessons when you're really young.
B: Forget it. Golf sounds more like work than fun.

A: Did you hear about the ball player?
B: The home run hitter on drugs?
A: He said a doctor helped him with a personal problem.
B: He said he wasn\x92t using drugs.
A: He apologized to the fans.
B: The league suspended him for 50 games.
A: That will cost him some money.
B: Yes, about $7 million.
A: That will teach him a good lesson.
B: He probably won\x92t use drugs anymore.
A: But it won\x92t stop other players from using drugs.
B: No. Everyone always figures that they won\x92t get caught.

A: I don't like riding the bus.
B: Why not?
A: The seats and windows are dirty.
B: Don't they clean the bus every night?
A: I think they do.
B: You should bring some wipes with you.
A: That's a good idea.
B: Then you can wipe your seat and window.
A: People will think I'm strange.
B: Who cares? Everyone is strange.
A: That's for sure.
B: Don't worry about what people think.

A: I don't like riding the bus.
B: Why not?
A: Number one, it's too slow.
B: You're right. A car is faster.
A: Number two, it's usually late.
B: You're right. The buses are never on time.
A: Number three, it doesn't run 24 hours.
B: You're right. Buses don't run late at night.
A: Number four, it's too crowded.
B: You're right. You have to stand in the aisle.
A: Number five, it's unsafe.
B: You're right. Bad guys might rob you.

A: We had a problem at school.
B: What was the problem?
A: Someone cut the tires.
B: What tires?
A: The tires on the cars.
B: Where were the cars?
A: They were in the student parking lot.
B: How many tires were cut?
A: One or two tires were cut on each car.
B: How many cars?
A: Eleven cars.
B: That's terrible. I hope they catch the person.

A: Life isn't fair.
B: It sure isn't.
A: I got a ticket yesterday.
B: What for?
A: I was crossing the street.
B: Were you in a crosswalk?
A: Yes, but the red hand was blinking.
B: So? That's a ticket?
A: Yes, it's a $140 ticket.
B: That's not right!
A: When I started to cross the street, the white walk sign was blinking.
B: You need to walk faster.

A: You're driving too fast.
B: Why do you say that?
A: The speed limit is 65.
B: I know that.
A: But you're doing 75.
B: So is everyone else.
A: But a cop might stop you.
B: No, he won't. Some cars are doing 85.
A: So the cop will stop those cars?
B: Of course. He stops the fastest cars.
A: My friend got a ticket for doing 75.
B: Your friend was unlucky.

A: Remember to put air in your tires.
B: How often do I have to do that?
A: Once every two months.
B: That's a lot.
A: What do you mean?
B: That's six times a year!
A: Yes, and it takes about five minutes each time.
B: I'll try.
A: Check your tires or you'll get a flat.
B: Oh. That's not good.
A: No, it isn't. A flat costs you time and money.
B: And I don't have either.

A: You're driving too fast.
B: I'm in a hurry.
A: Don't ever be in a hurry.
B: It's not my fault. You didn't wake me up.
A: That's not my fault. You didn't tell me to wake you up.
B: Well, I meant to.
A: Don't ever be in a hurry when you're driving.
B: Why not?
A: Because you'll have an accident. Most accidents are because people are in a hurry.
B: How do you know that?
A: I read a lot.
B: I thought drunks caused most accidents.

A: Let's go for a ride.
B: Where are we going?
A: Into the mountains.
B: That sounds nice.
A: I want to show you my new car.
B: You bought a new car?
A: Yes. I bought a Cadillac.
B: A luxury car.
A: Luxury plus speed.
B: What are we waiting for?
A: Let me get the keys.
B: Let me get my camera.

A: I have to go to the bathroom.
B: Why didn't you go before we left?
A: I did, but I have to go again.
B: Well, hold on a little longer.
A: I think I'm going to explode.
B: Just hold on.
A: Oh! Don't hit any more bumps!
B: We'll be at McDonald's in just a few minutes.
A: I hope they are fast minutes.
B: Think about something else. Think about a hamburger.
A: I'm thinking, but I still have to go.
B: It's the next exit. Hold on!

A: Where's the car?
B: What do you mean?
A: The car isn't here.
B: Where did you park it?
A: I parked it right here.
B: Are you sure?
A: Yes. I remember this big tree.
B: Maybe it's the wrong tree.
A: No, this is the tree.
B: Did someone steal it?
A: I sure hope not.
B: Maybe they towed it away.

A: Look at this traffic.
B: I'd rather not.
A: It gets worse every year.
B: Why are you complaining? We're going almost 20 miles an hour.
A: The speed limit is 65!
B: Well, that's between 2:00 and 4:00 a.m.
A: Where are all these people going?
B: They're all asking the same question.
A: When are they going to fix this problem?
B: They said they need more money.
A: They always need more money.
B: It'll get worse before it gets better.

A: Did you see that car?
B: Yes, he went through the red light.
A: Can we call the police?
B: No, the police don't care.
A: Why not?
B: They have to see it happen.
A: They don't believe us?
B: No. They can only give a ticket if they see it happen.
A: So, what do we do?
B: We don't do anything.
A: Maybe we should honk the horn next time.
B: The driver will just honk back at us.

A: My car is dirty.
B: Why don't you wash it?
A: That's what I'm going to do.
B: Are you going to wash it yourself?
A: Of course. It's not a hard job.
B: I'll help you.
A: Okay, I'll get a bucket.
B: I'll rinse the car first.
A: Then we can scrub it with a wet sponge and soap.
B: After that, we can dry it with a towel.
A: Then it will look like new
B: And you save $10.

A: It sure is windy today.
B: Paper is flying everywhere.
A: This wind is dangerous for drivers.
B: Especially for drivers of big trucks.
A: The wind blows those trucks over.
B: It blows trees over, too.
A: A tree fell onto my dad's car.
B: Was there much damage?
A: My dad had to buy a new car.
B: Wow! That's terrible.
A: Never park your car under a tree.
B: The wind will get you, or the birds will get you.

A: When are we going to stop?
B: We'll stop at the next McDonald's.
A: How far away is that?
B: I think we'll be there in half an hour.
A: I hope so. I have to go to the bathroom.
B: Well, I can always pull over.
A: No, thank you, I'll just wait.
B: We can kill two birds with one stone.
A: What do you mean?
B: While you're using the bathroom, I'll order some food.
A: Don't order for me. I'm not hungry.
B: I'm very hungry. I'll order for you, and then I'll eat yours.

A: This is such a long light.
B: Look how many cars are waiting in line.
A: They need a left-turn arrow.
B: Only two cars can make a left turn every three or four minutes.
A: We'll be here forever.
B: Get out of this lane.
A: But we need to turn left.
B: Forget it. Go straight.
A: Then what?
B: Then we'll just make a U-turn.
A: And then we can turn right at the light.
B: Good idea. It will be so much quicker.

A: I need a cheap car.
B: How much money do you have?
A: $1,000.
B: Well, that should get you something.
A: But I need something that's reliable.
B: You need a car with low mileage.
A: A car that was owned by a little old lady.
B: Where have you looked?
A: I haven't looked anywhere yet.
B: Why not?
A: Because I'll never find one for such a low price.
B: You're right about that. Keep saving your money.

A: Good afternoon, officer.
B: Your driver's license and registration, please.
A: Here you go.
B: Do you know why I pulled you over?
A: I have no idea. All of a sudden I heard your siren.
B: You rolled through that stop sign back there.
A: But I stopped!
B: No, you didn't. You slowed down, but you didn't come to a full stop.
A: Well, nobody else does, so why should I?
B: That's not the attitude of a good driver.
A: But I am a good driver. I've never had a ticket in my life.
B: Well, you've got one now. Here. Have a nice day.

A: $140. I can't believe it.
B: What are you talking about?
A: I got a ticket downtown for $140.
B: Were you speeding?
A: No, I was crossing the street.
B: Were you jaywalking?
A: No, I was in the crosswalk.
B: So why did you get a ticket?
A: The officer said the red hand was blinking.
B: Was it blinking when you entered the crosswalk?
A: No, the white WALK sign was blinking.
B: You should fight that ticket. I'll be your witness.

A: They were in a crosswalk near school at 3 a.m.
B: Who?
A: Two students from USC.
B: What happened?
A: A speeding car ran a red light, killing the girl.
B: What happened to the other student?
A: He landed on the hood of the car.
B: Did he get off the hood?
A: No, the car stopped and the passenger pushed the injured student off the hood.
B: I'll bet the car continued on its way.
A: Of course it did. Why stop after you've run over two people?
B: I hope they find them and put them in jail for life.

A: What happened to your car?
B: I got a dent in the parking lot.
A: How did you get it?
B: I don't know. Maybe it was from a shopping cart.
A: Those shopping carts are dangerous.
B: Especially the metal ones.
A: I don't park at a store that uses metal shopping carts.
B: That's a good idea, but there was a good sale at this store.
A: Did you save any money on the sale?
B: Yes, I did. I saved about $50.
A: That's great.
B: Yes, except this dent will cost about $150.

A: I went to Hawaii on vacation.
B: Did you like it?
A: I loved it. I want to live there.
B: What did you like?
A: The island is so green, and the water is so blue.
B: Did you go swimming?
A: I went to the beach every day.
B: How was the weather?
A: It was hot and sunny every day.
B: What did you do at night?
A: At night I went out to eat. The food was delicious.
B: People who live in Hawaii are lucky.

A: I like this hotel.
B: What do you like about it?
A: We get a free breakfast.
B: Coffee and a roll?
A: No, a real breakfast.
B: Bacon and eggs?
A: With toast, ham, sausage, fresh fruit, and juice.
B: Wow! That is nice. Let's stay for two nights.
A: And the rooms are clean, too.
B: Do they allow pets?
A: No pets, no smoking.
B: I like that. Let's stay three nights.

A: I'm not sleeping here tonight.
B: What's the matter? This is a nice room.
A: Maybe the room is nice, but not the bed.
B: What's wrong with the bed?
A: Look at this sheet.
B: Yes?
A: See those stains?
B: I sure do.
A: I'm not sleeping on that sheet.
B: Well, just call the front desk. They'll give us new sheets.
A: I want sheets without stains on them.
B: From now on, let's bring our own sheets.

A: What time does your plane leave?
B: It leaves at 12:15.
A: When do you have to be at the airport?
B: I have to be there two hours early.
A: So we have to be at the airport at 10:15.
B: That means we have to leave the house at 9:15.
A: Well, it's an hour to get there, if there are no traffic problems.
B: So maybe we better leave at 8:15?
A: Yes, it's better to get there too early than too late.
B: I agree.
A: You never know what might happen on these freeways.
B: There's at least one huge accident every day.

A: I need to fly to New York.
B: When are you going?
A: During the Christmas holidays.
B: You'd better buy your ticket now.
A: You must be kidding.
B: No, I'm not. It's March. Time is running out. Seats are selling out right now.
A: I thought I would wait until October.
B: I'll bet this is the first time you've ever flown during Christmas.
A: You're right.
B: Well, listen to me. You need to buy a ticket now.
A: But maybe prices will be cheaper in October.
B: Cheaper prices won't do you any good if there are no seats.

A: I hate flying.
B: So do I.
A: A long time ago, flying used to be okay.
B: Now it's like riding a bus.
A: You're jammed in with people all around you.
B: Half of them are coughing, and the other half are sneezing.
A: You don't have any elbow room or knee room.
B: People are always getting up to use the bathroom.
A: Kids are crying or climbing over you.
B: It's a flying zoo!
A: I wish I could afford first class seats.
B: Doesn't everybody?

A: Some guy rowed across the Atlantic Ocean.
B: Good for him.
A: Why would he do that?
B: Did he set a new record?
A: Yes, I think he did.
B: Well, I guess that's why he did it.
A: What's the point?
B: Now he has the world record!
A: But someone's going to break it, so what good is it?
B: Well, he can enjoy it while it lasts.
A: I don't think he even got paid for it.
B: Some people do it just to do it.

A: I want to go on a cruise ship.
B: That sounds like fun. Where do you want to go?
A: I want to cruise to Hawaii.
B: That should be a nice trip. Lots of fun, and lots of food.
A: I have no idea how much it will cost.
B: I think it depends on the season and on your cabin.
A: Well, of course I want to go when the weather is nice.
B: Yes, you don't want to travel in winter storms.
A: And I want to get a big cabin with a view.
B: Are you going to travel alone?
A: No, my sister and I will travel together.
B: Well, you should go online and try to find a good deal.

A: I hate to fly.
B: Because of all the security?
A: No, because it hurts my ears.
B: What do you mean?
A: Every time we land or take off, my ears hurt so much.
B: That's just the altitude change, I think.
A: Whatever it is, it hurts.
B: Can't you take medicine or something for it?
A: I've tried everything, but nothing works.
B: Have you tried earplugs?
A: They don't work, either.
B: Well, be glad you're not a pilot.

A: Spring break starts tomorrow.
B: Are you going to go anywhere?
A: I was thinking of driving to Arizona.
B: To the Grand Canyon?
A: Yes. I've never been there.
B: I was there when I was a kid.
A: How did you like it?
B: I loved it. I still remember how amazing it was.
A: I'm sure I'll like it, too.
B: You should try riding a mule on a trail to the bottom.
A: No way! I don't want to fall to my death.
B: Don't worry. Only one person has ever fallen off a mule.

A: That hotel was terrible.
B: The worst in the whole world.
A: The walls were so thin.

A: How did we end up in that terrible hotel?
B: The travel agent gave us a 50-percent discount!

A: I have to hang up. I'm so sleepy.
B: It's not even 10 o'clock.
A: I'm falling asleep on the phone.
B: You got up real early.
A: I had to take my friend to the airport.
B: Why didn't you take a nap when you got home?
A: I didn't get home until 30 minutes ago.
B: Why is that?
A: There was a bomb threat at the airport.
B: Only a threat?
A: Yes, but I was stuck there all day while they looked for the bomb.
B: Someday the bomb is going to be for real.

A: My dad went to Washington, D.C.

B: Tell me about it, Dad.
A: About 90 of us World War II veterans got on the plane at 8 a.m.
B: How long was the flight?
A: It only took about two hours.
B: Did you take pictures at the World War II Monument?
A: Oh, yes. We all took lots of pictures.
B: Then you flew back home that evening?

A: Oh, it did. There were about 300 people there to honor us.
B: Well, you all deserve it. You helped save our country.

A: Could I speak to the apartment manager?
B: I am the apartment manager. How can I help you?
A: I wanted to know if that apartment on Main Street is still for rent.

A: This is Janet Smith in apartment 23. Can I speak to the apartment manager?
B: Hi. How can I help you today?
A: Well, my window facing the empty lot is broken.
B: Oh, that's not good. What happened?
A: I dont know. I wasn't home when it happened.
B: Do you have any clue who might have done this?
A: I have a feeling that it might have been the neighborhood kids.
B: Why, what leads you to that suspicion?
A: Well, next to the broken glass was a baseball.
B: Well, a baseball is certainly solid evidence.
A: I saw them playing just before I left my apartment.
B: Well, did you recognize any of them?
A: No, I just took a quick look.
B: Well, it'll take a couple of days to repair it.
A: A friend of mine is in the business. How about if I call him?
B: That's okay by me. First, let me come see the damage.
A: Come on over. So does my friend charge you or me?
B: Since you didn't break it, you don't have to pay for it.
A: That's a relief. I thought I was going to get stuck with the bill.
B: If I knew which kid did it, I would bill his parents.

A: I'm Janet Smith in apartment 23. Is this the apartment manager?
B: Hello. What can I do for you today?
A: My living room window is broken.
B: Are you serious? Do you know what happened?
A: I am not really sure, because I was out when it occurred.
B: Do you have any idea who might have been behind this?
A: Something tells me it might be some of the kids in the complex.
B: What led you to think it might be the kids in this building?
A: I found a baseball near the broken glass.
B: Well, you can't ignore a baseball in your living room, can you?
A: I saw them in the lot just before I went out.
B: Do you know any of them?
A: No, I didn't pay any attention to who they were.
B: I'll call the window repairman, but it'll probably take a couple of days.
A: I could get fast service if I call a friend of mine.
B: I don't have a problem with that. Let me look at the damage first.
A: Okay, I'm waiting for you. But who does my friend give the bill to?
B: Since the kids broke it, your friend can bill me.
A: Whew! I was worried that I would have to pay for it.
B: Believe me, if I find out which kid broke the window, I'll bill his

A: This is Janet Smith in apartment 23. May I speak to the apartment manager?
B: Speaking. What can I do for you?
A: Something happened to my window. It's broken.
B: That doesn't sound good. Do you know how it happened?
A: I don't know the exact details.
B: Do you have an idea who might be responsible for the window?
A: I'm almost sure it is the local kids in the apartments.
B: How did you come to that conclusion?
A: There was a baseball in my living room along with the broken glass.
B: Well, at least there's no mystery about how it happened.
A: I saw a group of them playing in the lot just before I went out to my car.
B: Can you tell me which ones you recognized?
A: I just looked at them for a second.
B: I'll call a repairman, but it might take two days.
A: How about if I call a friend of mine who is a repairman?
B: That's no problem. I'll come by right now to look at the damage.
A: Okay. Come on over. But tell me, who pays for this?
B: You can pay for it, and I can reimburse you. Or he can bill me directly.
A: I'm glad to hear that. I didn't want to get stuck with the bill.
B: I will bill the kid's parents if I ever find out which kid did it.

A: Hello, I'm John Smith in unit 23. Am I speaking to the apartment manager?
B: This is he. How may I help you?
A: My window that faces the empty lot is broken.
B: I'm sorry to hear that. Why is it broken?
A: I can't tell you exactly how it happened.
B: Well, tell me what you think might have happened.
A: I've got a pretty good idea that it's the kids who live here.
B: Why do you think that?
A: Next to the broken glass in my living room was a baseball.
B: Well, you don't need Sherlock Holmes to figure this one out, do you?
A: Just before I went shopping, I saw them in the lot.
B: Can you give me a name or two, or a description?
A: I have absolutely no idea.
B: I'll call a repairman for you, but it'll probably take one or two days.
A: I could probably get it fixed today, because a friend of mine is a
B: That's okay. But let me see the damage first. I'm coming over.
A: The glass is all cleaned up, so come on over. But do I pay for this?
B: No. I will pay your friend, or I will reimburse you if you pay him.
A: That's good news. I was worried you were going to make me pay for this.
B: You're not at fault. But the kid who did it is.

A: This is John Smith in unit 23. Is this the apartment manager?
B: Hi. What do you need today?
A: I've got a broken living room window.
B: I'm sorry about that. How did it get broken?
A: I've got a good idea, but I'm not exactly sure.
B: Well, why don't you give me a few details?
A: I would bet a dollar to a dime that it's one of the local kids.
B: Do you have any support for that charge?
A: A baseball was on my living room carpet. I don't own a baseball.
B: Well, it sounds like someone hit a home run.
A: I saw them playing ball in the lot just before I went to the market.
B: Do you know for sure who they were?
A: All I did was glance at them before I left.
B: If you like, I'll call a repairman, but it might take a few days.
A: How about if I call my friend? He's a repairman and could probably fix it
B: Sure. Let me come over to see the damage right now, though.
A: Sure, come on over, but tell me, do I have to pay for this?
B: You're not responsible, so you don't pay. Tell him to bill me.
A: Well, lucky me. I was afraid that I was going to get stuck for the bill.
B: Maybe I'll install a camera on that end of the building to catch these

A: Can you give me a little more information about your apartment?
B: Sure, what can I help you with?
A: What kind of public transportation is near your apartment?
B: I'm not sure, but I believe there is a bus stop about three blocks away.
A: Do you know what direction that bus travels?
B: I'm sorry. If you check online, you can get that kind of information.
A: Okay, I'll just go online.
B: Okay. Good luck with your search.

A: Hello, I was hoping you could give me more info about your apartment.
B: I can try to help you. What would you like to know?
A: Is there access to public transportation near the apartment?
B: I'm pretty sure there's a bus stop within walking distance.
A: Do you know anything about the buses that stop there?
B: I don't know, but I'm pretty sure you can find out that stuff online.
A: I think the local library has bus info.
B: Good luck. The bus info shouldn't be too hard to find.

A: Can you give me a little more information about your apartment?
B: All right, what do you need to know?
A: What is the public transportation like near your apartment?
B: I don't use buses, but I think there's a bus stop a few blocks away.
A: Which route does the bus travel?
B: I wish I could help you, but I know nothing about the bus system.
A: I'll just check my phone book. It has lots of good information.
B: I'm sorry I couldn't help you more.

A: I was hoping you could give me more information about the apartment for
B: I can certainly try.
A: Do buses or trains run by the apartment?
B: I can't swear to it, but I think a bus stop is a couple of blocks away.
A: Where does the bus take you?
B: I don't want to lead you astray. You should check online.
A: My neighbor takes the bus. I'll ask him if he knows.
B: Bus line information should be pretty easy to find.

A: Could you give me a little more information about the apartment?
B: Sure, if I can. What do you want to know?
A: Is there a bus or train system near the apartment?
B: I'm pretty sure there's a bus stop only a few blocks away.
A: Do you know which buses stop there?
B: I'm sure there's an 800 number or a website that could help you.
A: I don't have a computer. I'll just look in my phone book.
B: Bus line information should be pretty easy to find.

A: Hello, this is Albert.
B: Hi. I'm Jack. You called about the room for rent. Are you still interested?
A: Yes, I am.
B: I was wondering if I could ask you a couple of questions.
A: Shoot.
B: I just want to be sure that we get along.
A: I agree with you 100 percent--we must get along.
B: Are you a party animal?
A: Oh, no. I'm a very quiet person.
B: Great! Next: Are you neat or are you a slob?
A: I'm a pretty neat person.
B: Are you a night owl or a day person?
A: Early to bed, early to rise.
B: Finally, do you smoke?
A: Actually, I quit smoking four years ago.
B: Excellent answers. Do you have any questions for me?
A: Just one: Is there a parking lot?
B: Unfortunately, you have to park in the street.
A: Well, I'm desperate. I'll take it anyway.
B: Great! Let me know when you're ready to move in.
A: I think it will be tomorrow if that's okay.
B: No problem. I'll be here all day tomorrow.

A: Hello. You've reached Albert.
B: I'm Jack. Are you still interested in renting a room?
A: Yes, very much so.
B: Would it be all right if I asked you some questions?
A: Fire away.
B: I just want to make sure that we are compatible.
A: That's a good idea. We need to get along.
B: Do you like to party?
A: I don't party, and I don't like people who do.
B: Great! Now, are you a neat person, or do you leave trash all over?
A: One of my mottoes is to clean as you go.
B: Do you sleep in or rise early?
A: I go to bed early, and I get up early.
B: And last, are you a smoker?
A: I can't stand cigarette smoke.
B: Excellent. Now, do you have any questions for me?
A: Only one. Where can I park my car?
B: I hate to tell you, but it's street parking.
A: I don't like it, but I need an apartment now, so I'll take it.
B: Great! Give me a call, and I'll help you move your stuff in.
A: Will tomorrow be okay with you?
B: That sounds good. I'll see you tomorrow.

A: Hi, this is Albert.
B: Hi, my name is Jack. You called about a room for rent. Are you still
A: Yes, more than you know.
B: I don't mean to pry, but could I ask you a couple of questions?
A: Ask away.
B: I don't want us to be roommates who don't get along.
A: Yes, we must get along if we are going to be roommates.
B: Is partying one of your priorities?
A: I'm a student. I don't have time to party.
B: Very good. Now, do you clean up after yourself?
A: I clean up my own mess, and I expect others to do so, too.
B: What time do you usually hit the sack?
A: Occasionally, I stay up late if there's a big test the next day.
B: What about smoking?
A: If I ever get elected President, I will ban smoking nationwide.
B: Very good. Now, would you like to ask me anything?
A: Yes, I have one question. Do I have to park in the street?
B: I'm sorry. Yes, you have to park your car in the street.
A: I hate street parking, but I need the apartment now.
B: Very good. Just call me when you're ready to move your stuff over here.
A: How about if I come over tomorrow afternoon?
B: Just ring the doorbell. I'll be here all day.

A: Hello, Albert speaking.
B: This is Jack. Are you still interested in renting a room?
A: Oh, yes.
B: Would you mind answering a couple of questions?
A: No problem.
B: Since we might be roommates, I want to make sure there's no friction.
A: You are right. We need to be compatible.
B: Do you go out to clubs or bars a lot?
A: I have been to only one nightclub in my whole life.
B: Good. Now, do you expect others to pick up after you?
A: Occasionally I might slip up, but usually I'm clean and neat.
B: What kind of hours do you keep?
A: The early bird gets the worm.
B: I hope you're not a smoker.
A: I can smell a cigarette from a mile away. It makes me gag.
B: Your answers are great. Now, do you have a question or two for me?
A: Just one question. What's the parking situation?
B: This place allows only one parking space per apartment, so you'll have to
A: I don't like it, but I guess I can live with it.
B: Okay, I think we'll be good roommates. Just call me when you're ready to
A: I can move in by tomorrow afternoon.
B: That's fine. I was planning on being home tomorrow anyway.

A: Hello, Albert here.
B: Hi, Albert. I'm Jack. Are you still thinking about renting a room?
A: Yes, I need a room badly.
B: Can I ask you a few questions?
A: I'm an open book.
B: I want to make sure that we get along okay.
A: I'm with you. We both need to live in harmony.
B: Do you like to drink and party?
A: I hate noise, and I hate loud people.
B: Excellent. Now, do you leave a trail of trash wherever you go?
A: A place for everything, and everything in its place.
B: Do you keep normal hours?
A: I'm usually asleep before the 11 o'clock news.
B: You don't have a cigarette habit, do you?
A: Cigarette smoking is the dumbest habit in the world.
B: I like your answers. Now, are there any questions you'd like to ask me?
A: Yes, is the parking off street, or on street?
B: You're not going to like this. It's street parking only.
A: That figures, nothing is perfect. But, I'll take it.
B: You know, I think we're going to hit it off. Call me when you're coming
A: I can get all packed tonight and be there tomorrow.
B: Just come on over anytime. I'll be here the whole day.

A: Hi, Tom. This is Hannah from apartment 4C.
B: Oh, hi, Hannah.
A: There is something wrong with my garbage disposal.
B: Exactly what's going on?
A: When I turn on the disposal switch, all I get is silence.
B: When did this happen?
A: Well, about a week ago is when it started sounding strange.
B: Did you accidentally drop something in the disposal?
A: No. I only use it about once a week. I hardly ever put anything into it.
B: Actually, I've heard that too little use is bad for a disposal.
A: Well, no one ever told me that.
B: Did you try to turn it with the disposal key?
A: I don't have a key.
B: Well, I've got a spare key, so I'll come over to show you how to use it.
A: Okay, come on over now, and show me how to use it.
B: If the key doesn't work, I'll have to call the repairman.
A: Well, if it doesn't work, it's no big deal.
B: Yes, but if something's broken, I like to get it fixed ASAP.

A: Tom, are you there? It's Hannah from 4C.
B: Hey, Hannah. Long time no hear from.
A: My garbage disposal refuses to work.
B: What happens when you turn on the switch?
A: When I turn on the switch, nothing happens.
B: When did you first notice this?
A: A week ago it started sounding different.
B: Did you put something in it that you shouldn't have?
A: I use it rarely. When I do use it, I put pasta or other soft food into it.
B: Maybe you haven't been using the disposal enough.
A: Sort of like an air conditioner in your home or car?
B: Exactly. However, sometimes you can get it going again by using the key.
A: What key?
B: A disposal key. I've got a spare one, so I'll come over to show you.
A: Okay, come on over now, and show me how to use it.
B: If the key doesn't correct the problem, I'll have to call someone.
A: Well, like I said, I rarely use it so it won't be a problem.
B: Well, it's my nature to fix things as soon as I can.

A: Is anybody home? It's me--Hannah.
B: Hey, Hannah. How's everything going?
A: My garbage disposal isn't working.
B: Can you be a little more specific?
A: Nothing happens when I turn on the switch.
B: Do you remember how it started?
A: about a week ago I noticed a new sound.
B: You didn't drop a fork or anything into it, did you?
A: I don't use it very often. When I do use it, I put only soft food into it.
B: I've heard that disposals need to be run frequently.
A: That's interesting. I never heard that before.
B: Have you tried to turn it manually using the key?
A: I don't have a key, and I wouldn't know how to use it.
B: I've got an extra key. I'll show you how to use it.
A: I'm always willing to learn something new. Come on over.
B: The key might not work. Then I'll have to call the plumber.
A: If it works or doesn't work, it doesn't matter much to me.
B: Yes, but I prefer to fix things now instead of later.

A: Hello, Tom? This is Hannah in 4C.
B: Hi, Hannah. What can I do for you?
A: My garbage disposal went south.
B: Does it turn at all?
A: There is nothing but silence when I turn on the switch.
B: Did it die suddenly?
A: It started to make a weird sound last week.
B: You didn't try to grind up a dead body, did you?
A: No, that's against the law, isn't it? I only use it on soft food, maybe
B: Strange as it seems, a disposal should be run frequently.
A: Once a week might not be enough, huh?
B: There's a key that will turn it manually to loosen it up.
A: Even if I could find this key, I wouldn't know how to use it.
B: How about if I bring one over and show you how to use it?
A: Great, come on over, and teach me all about garbage disposal keys.
B: The key isn't a guarantee. I still might have to call a repairman.
A: It's no big deal to me if you can fix it or not.
B: Well, we don't want the food that's in there to start to smell bad, do we?

A: Hi, Tom. This is Hannah calling.
B: Hi, Hannah. What's up?
A: I think my garbage disposal kicked the bucket.
B: Is it dying, or is it dead?
A: Turning on the switch is the same as not turning on the switch.
B: Did it make strange sounds before it croaked?
A: Last week I noticed that it sounded strange.
B: You haven't been putting mango or avocado seeds in there, have you?
A: I use the disposal rarely. When I do use it, I put only soft food into it.
B: I think a disposal freezes up when it's not used frequently.
A: You mean it's sort of like use it or lose it?
B: Try loosening it up by using the disposal key.
A: Disposal key? I have a house key and a car key, but no disposal key.
B: Well, I've got an extra key. I'll bring it over.
A: Okay, Come on over, and show me how to fix this thing.
B: Sometimes the key works, sometimes it doesn't. I still might have to call a
A: Well, there's no big hurry, as far as I am concerned.
B: If we don't fix it sometime, your apartment might start to attract bugs or

A: Yes, this is John Smith.
B: John, this is Terry Evans. I called to tell you I have good news.
A: Great, what is it?
B: The owner has approved your rental application. He enjoyed talking to you.
A: That's great. He seemed like a really nice guy.
B: Now, before you can move in, you need to pay some fees.
A: Fees, what kind of fees?
B: You know. First and last month's rent and security deposit.
A: Oh, those fees!
B: First and last is $2,500, and the deposit is $1,000. Just send me a check
A: No problem, what's your address?
B: Send it to 3035 E. Foothill Blvd., Pasadena, CA 91107.
A: So, when can I move in?
B: The first of next month. Just stop by my office and pick up your keys.
A: Very good! Let me have your phone number.
B: Sure. It's 626-555-3000.

A: John speaking.
B: John, my name is Terry Evans. I have good news for you.
A: I'm all ears. What is it?
B: Your rental application has been approved. The owner thinks you'll be an
A: Oh, that's so good. It makes my day.
B: Now, before you move in, you have to pay some fees.
A: Fees, what are you talking about?
B: You know--first and last month's rent, and the security deposit.
A: Oh, of course. When you said fees, I was thinking of parking fees or
B: That will come to $3,500, 2,500 plus $1,000. You can send me the check.
A: I'll do that immediately. Where do I send it?
B: Mail it to 3035 E Foothill Blvd, Pasadena, CA 91107.
A: One more question. When can I move in?
B: You can move in on the first. Stop by here and pick up your keys.
A: Great! What's your phone number?
B: My number is 626-555-3000.

A: I'm John Smith. How can I help you?
B: Hi, John. This is Terry Evans. I've got some good news for you.
A: I hope you're from the lottery. Go ahead.
B: The apartment owner was impressed with your interview. He has approved your
A: Oh, my gosh. That's wonderful news!
B: Of course, there are some fees to pay before you move in.
A: Fees? I don't remember anything about fees.
B: You know, the usual--first and last month's rent, and the security deposit.
A: But, of course. You cannot move in unless you pay such fees.
B: So, you can write me a check for $3,500. That's $2,500 and $1,000 deposit.
A: No sooner said than done. Where shall I mail it?

B: The apartment owner likes you. He has approved your rental application.
A: Oh, thank you. That's the news I was hoping to hear!
B: Before you move in, of course, you have to pay some fees.
A: Fees, I'm confused. What fees are you talking about?
B: You know, the security deposit, and the first and last month's rent.
A: Oh, I got it. I thought you were talking about something else.

A: Sure, let me have it.
B: The apartment owner likes you. He approved your rental application.
A: Wow, that's fantastic! I don't know what to say.
B: Now you can't move in, of course, until you've paid some fees.
A: Fees, I don't remember anything about fees.
B: Fees, like the first and last month's rent, and the security deposit.
A: Oh, yes, of course, those fees!
B: You can send me a check for the total--$2,500 plus $1,000 equals a total of

A: Hello, Nicole here.
B: Nicole, this is Richard. I think you know why I'm calling.
A: Oh, it's about the rent.
B: Yes, this is the second month in a row.
A: I thought there was a grace period.
B: There is no grace period in the rental agreement.
A: Oh, I guess I forgot.
B: Well, when can I expect the rent?
A: You'll get it by Monday.
B: Don't forget the $50 late fee.
A: Is that in the rental agreement?
B: The late fee is circled in red ink!
A: Oh, Well, I can't find my copy of the agreement.
B: If you're late next month, I might give you an eviction notice.

A: Hi, this is Nicole.
B: Hi, Nicole. Richard here. I think you've got a good idea why I'm calling.
A: Yes. It's about the rent, isn't it?
B: Yes, your rent is late. This is the second month in a row.
A: But I thought that I had a grace period.
B: I told you last month that the rental agreement contains no grace period.
A: Oh, I guess I was thinking about the last place that I lived.
B: Well, tell me when I'm going to get your rent.
A: I get paid tomorrow, so you'll get the check by Monday.
B: Don't forget to include the $50 late fee.
A: Are you sure a late fee is in the rental agreement?
B: How could you miss the late fee? It's circled in red ink!
A: I can't find my copy of the rental agreement. I know it's somewhere in my
B: If you're late one more time, I'm probably going to evict you.

A: Hello, Nicole here. Who's calling, please?
B: Hey, Nicole. It's Richard. I'm pretty sure you know why I'm calling.
A: Yes, a dollar gets a dime that you're calling about the rent.
B: Nicole, for the second month in a row, your rent is late.
A: I thought you said there is a grace period.
B: No, I didn't. There was no grace period last month, this month, or any
A: Maybe I'm confusing this place with my last place.
B: Well, I'm waiting to receive your rent check.
A: I get my money tomorrow, so I can pay you by Monday.
B: Remember, just like last month, you have to pay the $50 late fee.
A: I don't remember seeing a late fee in the rental agreement.
B: If you look at your agreement, you'll see the late fee circled in red ink!
A: I forget where I put my rental agreement.
B: One more late check, and you're looking at eviction.

A: Hello. This is Nicole.
B: This is Richard. Let's not play games. You know why I'm calling.
A: Oh, not again! You're calling about the rent.
B: Yes, your rent check is late, just like last month.
A: What happened to my grace period?
B: Why would there be a grace period this month? There wasn't one last month.
A: I guess I might be a little confused.
B: What day in the near future can I expect your check?
A: My boss told me he will pay me tomorrow. You'll get my check by Monday.
B: Remember to include the $50 late fee.
A: Are you sure the rental agreement included a late fee?
B: The red ink around the late fee in your agreement should tell you
A: I seem to have lost my rental agreement.
B: Don't be late again, or you'll be evicted.

A: Hi, this is Nicole.
B: Nicole, it's Richard. You know why I'm calling.
A: Yes, I know. It's the rent, isn't it?
B: Yes, just like last month, your rent is overdue.
A: What about my grace period?
B: Are you getting Alzheimer's? There is no grace period in the rental
A: Sometimes my memory isn't so good. Maybe I do have Alzheimer's.
B: I'm looking forward to receiving your check in the very near future.
A: Is Monday okay? I get paid tomorrow.
B: Remember that the check amount must include the $50 late fee.
A: Okay, if the rental agreement actually has a late fee, I'll pay the fifty dollars.
B: Look at your agreement. There's a big red circle around the late fee.
A: As soon as I find my rental agreement, I'll read it again.
B: I'm not giving you any more chances. Be late again, and you'll be evicted.

A: Hello, Betty speaking.
B: Hey, Betty. This is Larry. Tell me how many smoke detectors you have, please.
A: This apartment came with one, and I installed another one.
B: Are there fresh batteries in each of them?
A: Each detector beeps when the battery is low. They're not beeping.
B: Good. I'm calling all the tenants because I have to check all the
A: Okay, What day were you thinking about dropping by?
B: I'll be at your building at noon on Thursday. If you're not there, I'll let

A: Not a problem. When will you be here?
B: I'll be letting myself into all the apartments on Thursday at noon.

B: Do you know how new the batteries are?
A: I'm very afraid of fires. I change the batteries every Labor Day.
B: Good. I'm calling all the tenants before I come by to test the detectors.
A: My detectors are ready for you. When will you be visiting?
B: This Thursday at noon. But you don't have to be there.
A: Okay, just pardon the mess when you come in.
B: You'll never even know that I was there.

A: Hello, Nicole? This is Jimmy in 309.
B: Hello, Jimmy. What's up?
A: You're not going to believe this.
B: Believe me, I think I've heard everything.
A: I can't find my mailbox key.
B: Is that all? That's a lot better than losing your car keys.
A: I had a duplicate, but I can't find it either.
B: If you come by my place, I can loan you a key.
A: There's no emergency. All I get is junk mail and bills.
B: Can you wait till Wednesday? I'll make you two more keys.
A: Sure, that'll be fine.
B: Okay. I'll see you Wednesday. But it's going to cost you $2 per key.

A: Can I speak to Nicole? This is Jimmy in apartment 309.
B: Hi, Jimmy. This is Nicole. What's happening?
A: You probably never heard this one before.
B: Don't bet on it. I've been an apartment manager for a long time.
A: I've looked everywhere, but I can't find my mailbox key.
B: Well, that's pretty minor. I lost my car keys and house keys once.
A: To make matters worse, I can't find my duplicate either.
B: If you want, come over here and I'll lend you a key.
A: No, there's nothing vital in the mailbox. Just junk and bills.
B: If you can wait until Wednesday, I'll make two more keys for you.
A: Wednesday's fine.
B: Okay, I'll bring them by Wednesday. Have $4 ready for me.

A: Hi, Nicole. This is Jimmy in 309.
B: Hello, Jimmy. Can I help you?
A: I've got a little problem.
B: Tell me your problem, and maybe I can help.
A: I've looked everywhere, but I can't find my mailbox key.
B: Well, that's pretty minor. I lost my car keys and house keys once.
A: As if that wasn't bad enough, I also misplaced the duplicate.
B: Well, if it's an emergency, come by here and I'll lend you a key.
A: No, even if there's a bill in there, it can wait.
B: If you don't mind waiting until Wednesday, I'll make two more keys for you.
A: Oh, I can wait, believe me.
B: Okay, see you Wednesday. They're not free, you know. It'll be $4.

A: Hey, Nicole. It's Jimmy in 309.
B: Hi there, Jimmy. What can I do for you?
A: I screwed up, and I need your help.
B: Tell me the specific problem. Let me see what I can do.
A: I've torn my apartment apart, but I can't find my mailbox key.
B: Well, you should be grateful it wasn't your car keys.
A: On top of that, I couldn't find the duplicate either.
B: If you need to get in there, come by and borrow a key.
A: No, my mailbox is usually empty anyway.
B: Well, then, I'll make you two more keys on Wednesday.
A: No problem. I can wait till Wednesday. Maybe there'll be something in there
B: Okay. Have $4 ready for when you see me Wednesday.

A: Hello? This is Jimmy in 309.
B: Hi, Jimmy. This is Nicole. What's going on?
A: Maybe you can get me out of a small jam.
B: Well, I can certainly try.
A: Somehow, I managed to lose my mailbox key.
B: Believe me, losing a mailbox key is a lot better than losing your car keys.
A: I've got a duplicate somewhere, but I haven't been able to find it either.
B: If you absolutely can't wait, come over here and borrow a key.
A: No, I doubt that there's anything important in my mailbox, if there's
B: Well, if there's no emergency, I can make you two more keys on Wednesday.
A: Not a problem. All my fan mail can wait till then.
B: Okay, see you Wednesday. Have $4 for me, and I'll give you a receipt.

B: Yes, I know. I'm going to have another talk with them.
A: Anyway, it's been nice knowing you for these past few years.
B: You, too. Keep in touch, and good luck with your new job.

A: How's it going, Jim? This is Olivia.
B: Hello, Olivia. What's up?
A: I wanted to let you know that I have to move out.
B: I'm sorry to hear that. When are you moving?
A: The thirtieth of June.
B: May I ask why you're leaving?
A: I found a new job.
B: Good for you! What's your new job?
A: I am an ESL teacher at Pasadena City College.
B: Very good! What does ESL mean?
A: ESL means English as a Second Language.
B: Well, I'm glad you're not moving because of your neighbors.
A: I can't tell you how happy I'll be not to have to listen to their TV.

A: You've been a good apartment manager and a good person. I'll see you in
B: Thank you. I hope your new job and new apartment are good for you.

A: Hey, Jim. How are you? Olivia here.
B: Hi, Olivia. What's going on?
A: I just wanted to give you notice that I'm moving.
B: Oh, that's too bad. What's the moving date?
A: I'll be gone on the last day in June.
B: Can I ask you why you're moving?
A: I've been looking for a long time, and I finally found a good job.
B: Very good! What's your new job?
A: I'm going to teach ESL at Pasadena City College.
B: Good for you! What does ESL stand for?
A: ESL is English as a Second Language.
B: Well, I'm glad you don't feel you're being chased out by your neighbors.
A: Their TV is so loud you'd think they were stone deaf.
B: I'll tell them one more time to turn down their TV. Then I'm going to evict
A: Thanks for all your help over the past few years.
B: Thanks. Good luck with your new neighbors and your new job.

A: Hi, Jim. It's Olivia.
B: Hey, Olivia. What's happening?

A: The last day of June.
B: Is something wrong with your apartment?
A: No, not anything new. But I just found out that I've been hired for a new

A: I'm going to be an ESL instructor at Pasadena City College.
B: That's great! ESL is some kind of electronics class?
A: ESL is a class for students who are learning English as their second
B: I'm glad that your neighbors aren't the reason that you're moving.
A: I won't miss having to listen to their darn TV.
B: I'm giving them one more warning about their TV. Then they're out of there.
A: I appreciate what a good apartment manager you've been these past few
B: It's been nice knowing you, too. Good luck teaching LES.

A: Hello, Jim. It's Olivia.
B: Hi, there. What can I do for you today?
A: You should know that I'll be moving out in a while.
B: Gee, that's too bad. What day do you plan to leave?
A: June 30 is my last day.
B: I hope it's not your neighbors or the latest rent increase.
A: No, neither one. I got lucky. I found a new job.
B: Hey, give me five! Good for you! What is it?
A: I'll be teaching ESL at Pasadena City College.
B: Great! Is ESL a class about the Internet?
A: No. ESL is English for students whose native language is not English.
B: I was worried that you were moving because of your neighbors.
A: Whoever my next neighbor is cannot possibly be as loud as those people.
B: I'm going to give them 30 days' notice if they don't turn that TV down.
A: Thanks for everything. I'll give you the keys on the thirtieth.
B: You've been a very good tenant. Good luck with your new SLE job.

A: I heard it from one of our friends.

B: You know, with a little elbow grease and paint, you could spruce it up a
A: There are hardly any windows in here, and that makes it really gloomy.
B: Let's go check out the kitchen. The printout says that it is quite large.
A: Look at those broken tile countertops and the peeling wallpaper.
B: Maybe the master suite has some redeeming qualities. Follow me, please.
A: What's that smell?
B: Perhaps we should move on to the next listing.

A: This house is not looking all that great from here

B: It is best to start a little low on the first bid to allow for a
A: I hope that the owners aren't insulted by that offer.
B: Your offering price is not out-of-line. The owners will either take it or

B: The owners have counter-offered three hundred and thirty-five thousand
A: Should I accept their offer?
B: There are two ways to respond. You can either come back with another
A: What if I make another offer, and they don't accept it?
B: No one else has made an offer, so you could make another offer if you
A: I think that I would like to offer three hundred and thirty thousand
B: OK, I will present your counter-offer to the owners tonight.
A: How long before I find out what their decision is?
B: By now, the owners probably have a pretty good idea of what they will

A: Your office called and said that the owners had made a counter-offer to
B: To your offer of three hundred and twenty thousand dollars, the owners
A: I think that maybe I should accept their offer.
B: You, of course, have two ways of responding. You can say yes or come up

A: Let's try going with three hundred and thirty thousand dollars for a
B: I will contact the sellers with your current offer.

B: What happened that you didn't get it done?
A: I had to watch a football game instead.
B: Well, you had more than one day; couldn't you have fit it in on another day?
A: Yes, I think so.
B: Either way, I only allow one missed assignment per semester. When will you be turning the make-up in?
A: I'll make it up next week.
B: Fine, but it cannot happen again if you want an \x93A\x94 in the class.
A: OK, I can do that.
B: Remember that you are in college now, not high school.

A: I don't have my homework today.
B: You usually are good about turning it in; what happened?
A: I was really sick.
B: But couldn't you have done it when you felt better?
A: Yes, I probably could.
B: You have already missed one other assignment; when can I expect the make-ups?
A: Next class meeting.
B: That will be soon enough, but make sure you get next week's assignment in as
A: That would work for me.
B: Good. I know that you are capable of being an excellent student.

A: Let me tell you what happened to my homework.
B: OK, go ahead--what is the excuse THIS time?
A: Actually, I did it, but then it got lost.
B: Could you have gotten it done at another time?
A: Yes, I could.
B: You have never missed an assignment before--when will you be making this one
A: I'll make it up early next week.
B: That would work, but don't let it happen again.
A: I'll try.
B: That will solve it then. Let's work hard to not let it happen again.

A: Excuse me, Professor. I think there might be an error in my test score.
B: Sure. Do you think that the total is wrong or that you got something marked
A: I think that the percentage is incorrect.
B: Let's just go over all of it to double-check.
A: Sure, let's do it.
B: Here is the answer sheet. Do you see a place where I marked something wrong
A: I don't see any mistakes.
B: OK, now that we've gotten those straightened out, let's total the score.
A: Yes, let's total it.
B: Well, if I total that like this and divide by this number, I get this total.
A: Yes, you're right.
B: Well then, we are all straight. Have a good day and thanks for bringing that

A: I was looking at my test score and think that it should be higher.
B: Is the math wrong or the way the answer was marked?
A: I think an answer got marked wrong that should have been marked right.
B: These things can happen; let's double-check the answers first to be sure, all
A: That would be great!
B: Look at the answer sheet and compare it to your answers. Do you see any place
A: This one right here should be right.
B: Yeah, I see the same thing; now we can do the math and check that, right?
A: Yeah, let's do the math.
B: I count all of the correct answers, total them, and divide by the total. Does
A: Looks pretty good.
B: Thank you for caring enough to check on your scores; keep studying!

A: Could we go over some things, because I think my test score is wrong.
B: What do you think is wrong, the math or the way your answer was scored?
A: Both.
B: I am willing to take a second look because teachers make mistakes, too. Will
A: Yeah, I'm ready.
B: Check your answers against the ones on the answer sheet and let me know where
A: These look strange.
B: Yes, I agree; let's move on to the calculating of the score. Would that be
A: OK, let's do the calculation.
B: We add all of these up and divide by this and that gives us this percentage.
A: I see.
B: Anytime you have a question, please feel free to ask!

A: Do you have the notes from last week's class?
B: Did you come late?
A: I couldn't make it.

A: I was wondering how you are going to calculate our final grades.
B: Grades are based on many things: homework, attendance, quizzes, mid-term, and
A: What counts the most?
B: Actually I look at all of it and let's not forget class participation.
A: Do you grade on a curve or use percentages?
B: Homework, attendance, and quizzes are sixty percent; the mid-term and final
A: What if we miss something?
B: I will allow one unexcused absence; after that you need to contact me ahead
A: Will you tell us if we are failing during the year?
B: You will be able to track your progress during the year.

A: What do you base our grades on?
B: All of your coursework is important, including everything from attendance and
A: Does the final count the most?
B: All of it is important; please just do your best at all times.

B: The final and mid-term are twenty percent each; homework, attendance, and
A: What if we are out sick?
B: Make sure you contact me as I only allow one unexcused absence.
A: How can we know if we are doing OK during the year?
B: Your grade will not be a surprise; you will know what you need to work on.

A: How do you decide what grade we get?
B: I look at many things: attendance, quizzes, and tests.
A: What is the most important factor?
B: Obviously I look for improvement as we go along, but I would like you to do

B: I will be letting you know during the year if you have a major problem.

A: I'd like to talk to you about my grades.
B: Sure! What exactly do you have questions about?
A: I am worried that I messed up on a test.
B: Well, let me take a look at my grade book. How do YOU think you are doing?
A: I think I am doing great, except for that one test!
B: Well, your scores show that you could do a little better. What do you think
A: I think that I could study a little harder for tests.
B: Fine! Please remember that regular attendance is the most important way to
A: Yes, I know.
B: I'm sure you'll do fine.

A: Could you talk to me for a few minutes about my grades?
B: Step into my office for a moment. What is your concern?
A: Am I failing?
B: Let's go on the computer to see what's up. Do you think you are doing well?
A: I am pretty sure that I am in trouble.
B: I can see that you are trying, but where do you think you could improve?
A: I missed a few classes; I need to make sure I come to school on a regular

A: I'll try; it's hard!
B: Thanks for stopping by!

A: Professor, I'm concerned about my grades. Do you have a minute?
B: Of course, how can I help you?
A: I want to know if I am doing OK.
B: Let's pull out your scores so far. Do you think you are doing OK?
A: I am afraid that I might not be doing all that well.
B: I'm seeing that you are doing OK in some areas, but not so well in others.
A: I think I could take better notes and read a little more.
B: You can greatly improve your grades by always reflecting on what you can
A: I'm working on it!
B: Just do your best and I am sure that you will see improvement.

A: Excuse me, Professor. I am going to miss next week's class.
B: Is this something that you could schedule for another time?

A: Can you help me figure out how to use this machine?
B: Yes, I would be happy to help. What do you want to buy?
A: I want to buy that candy.
B: OK. So this machine will make change if you need it. Do you have your dollars
A: Yeah, so far, so good.
B: Next, you feed your dollars into the machine in the slot. Make sure they are
A: Yeah, I already knew that.
B: I'm sure you know that if the dollar gets stuck, you might have to re-feed
A: OK, let's move on!
B: Now you just make your selection and pray. If nothing comes out, try again or
A: I hope it works!
B: Well, good luck!

A: I've never seen a machine like this before and need some help.
B: Sure, no problem. What are you trying to get?
A: I want to buy a drink.
B: OK. This machine needs you to use that change machine first to get correct
A: I've got the correct change already.
B: First you put your money in the dollar slot or the coin slot. The dollars
A: OK, what next?
B: Just know that sometimes the money doesn't go in perfectly the first time and
A: OK, next?
B: Choose what you want and push the button. Sometimes it takes a couple of
A: I agree with you.
B: Hope that works for you!

A: I want to know how to buy something from this machine.
B: Yeah, the new ones can be tricky. What are you trying to buy?
A: I want to buy one of those snack things.
B: Are you ready to go?
A: I'm clear so far.
B: The money goes in the slot over there. It has to be smooth to go in.
A: It won't go in!
B: Just remember that you might have to feed the money in a couple of times to
A: Yes, next step.
B: Make your selection and hope for the best. Vending machines aren't all that
A: They're totally unreliable.
B: You seem to have it down. Have a good day!

A: Excuse me. I am interested in getting a library card.
B: Sure, let me give you an application. You can fill it out right here at the counter.
A: OK, here it is.

B: Everything you need to know is printed on the card and handout.
A: Yes, right.
B: Great! You are all set to enjoy the library.

A: Good morning. Is this where I can get a library card issued to me?
B: No problem, we have a short form right here; just hand it to me when you are
A: I'm done.
B: That looks great, but I will also need your driver's license or other form of
A: Sure, here it all is.
B: Well, this looks nice. Do you know how to use it?

B: Of course, just remember that all of the needed information is on the card.
A: I see.
B: Well, I hope you have a wonderful time on your library visits!

A: Can you help me with returning my late books?
B: This is the right spot to pay your fee. Put your books down right here.
A: OK, here they are.
B: I can see that you owe 25 cents a day. That will be one dollar and fifty
A: OK, here's the money.
B: We are interested in getting our books back; so as long as all the fines are
A: I'm not sure.
B: Your registration and transcripts can be held up if there is an outstanding
A: Now I understand.
B: Well, you can always keep your late fees down by using the night drop if we

A: These books should have been turned in last week.
B: You have come to the correct place. Hand me your books.
A: Here they are.
B: Whoa, these are pretty late! You owe five dollars total to clear your fine.
A: I don't have the money right now.
B: We only require that all fines must be paid off by the end of the semester.
A: What would happen if I didn't pay it?
B: It's really important to always clear your fines, so you'll get a report card
A: Yeah, but I don't know how they can do that.
B: Always remember that the night drop is here, and we really appreciate you

A: My library books are late, where can I put them?
B: This is where they need to be turned in. Let me see them to check the date,
A: Yeah, I think that they are really late!
B: Not all that late. You only owe the library fifty cents.
A: What if I can't pay it?
B: We appreciate you paying off all fines as soon as possible, but always before
A: Yeah, I get it.
B: Your report card and transcripts will be held until you pay all fines, so
A: That's not really fair!
B: If we aren't here, always feel free to use the night drop outside. Thanks for

A: Excuse me, could you help me figure out how to use this new parking meter?
B: Sure, it was confusing for me also. Have you ever used a regular meter?
A: Yes, I understood the old one.
B: Well, on this one you can use coins or a debit or credit card; which one would you like to use?
A: Debit or credit card.
B: OK. Now, do you see what the rate is on the sticker?
A: Yes.
B: OK, now that we know what it will cost, put the money or card into the machine.
A: Yes, I can do that.
B: Wonderful; now, this machine asks you the number of your spot, so put that in also.
A: Yes, I'm ready.
B: All you have to do now is take your receipt and put it on your dashboard.

A: Whoa, I never saw a meter like this before; how do you use it?
B: It's simple, once you do it a few times. Do you know how the old one worked?
A: I never used a parking meter before.
B: So we start out by deciding whether you will use cash or a credit or debit
A: Cash.
B: Fine, can you read the rate on the display?
A: Yes, I can.
B: Fine. Now that we know what they are ripping us off for, insert the payment.
A: I'd rather not pay, but I have to.
B: Fine, this machine does not ask you the number of your spot, so we can move
A: Perfect, let's do it.
B: Now just check the meter to see how many minutes you have.

A: This parking meter is really confusing. Can you help me figure it out?
B: It's just like the old one, but with new stuff added.
A: Yeah, OK.
B: The first step is deciding on debit or credit card payment, so which one is
A: I have coins.
B: Perfect. Now, can you see the rate on the sign?
A: I didn't see that, but now I do.
B: Once you know what it will cost, put the payment in.
A: Here it goes!
B: You are doing great! Let's move on to the next step.
A: I am a little confused.
B: Just make sure that everything registered, and then you are good to go!

A: I'd like to purchase a parking permit for next semester.
B: Are you a daytime student or do you just come in the evenings?
A: I am a daytime student.
B: Will you be driving a motorcycle or a car?
A: I will be driving my car.
B: OK, that will be twenty-five dollars. How would you like to pay for it?
A: I'll pay for it with a check.
B: Would you like to pay for any extra permits for another vehicle?
A: No, thanks; I'm fine.
B: Here you go then. Have a great school year!

A: I'll need a parking permit for next semester.
B: Do you attend school during the day or only at night?
A: I only attend class part-time in the evenings.
B: Do you drive a motorcycle or an automobile?
A: I have both, but I usually use my car to get to school.
B: Great, the price for that permit is thirty dollars; cash, check, or credit card?
A: I'll pay cash.
B: Do you need to buy a duplicate permit for a second vehicle?
A: No, thank you.
B: OK, here is your permit; enjoy the new semester.

A: I want to buy a parking permit, please.
B: Are you a full-time student or do you attend part-time in the evenings?
A: I attend both day and evening classes.
B: Will you be riding a motorcycle or do you drive a car?
A: I ride a motorcycle.
B: That permit will run twenty-five dollars; will that be cash or credit card?
A: I'll use a credit card, thank you.
B: Do you need a second permit for a car?
A: No, just the motorcycle permit.
B: Fine, here it is and have a great semester!

A: Can you tell me where I can park?
B: Are you driving a motorcycle or an automobile?
A: I drive an automobile.
B: Fine. You can either park in the student lot or on the street. Do you know
A: Yes, I have seen those spots.
B: Well, when you see the blue spots with the handicapped logo, do not park
A: I park in the evenings.
B: Then you also need to be aware of the time limits on the street signs. Have
A: Yes, I have seen those signs.
B: The signs always tell you how long you can park there and on what days. Do
A: Yes, I know what the curb colors mean.
B: Well, just as long as you realize that red means no parking and white means

A: Where should I park?
B: Do you have a car or motorbike?
A: I drive a scooter
B: In that case, you can park either in a student lot or on the street. Are you
A: No, I haven't seen those spots.
B: The handicapped logo with blue means that you are not to park there unless
A: I park in the daytime.
B: Make sure you pay special attention to the street signs with time limits.
A: No, I have not seen the signs.
B: Pay attention to what the signs tell you in terms of time limits and what
A: No, I don't know what the curb colors mean.
B: Just remember that red means absolutely no parking and white means loading

A: What is the best place to park?
B: What vehicle do you usually bring to school? Is it an automobile or a
A: I drive a motorcycle.
B: OK. That means you can park in the student lot or on the street. Have you
A: I am not sure what a handicapped spot is.
B: Look for the blue signs and blue marked spaces. Do you usually park in the
A: I park days and evenings.
B: Be careful about the time limits on the streets. Have you seen the signs for
A: What signs?
B: As long as you are careful reading the signs, you will always know how long
A: What curb colors?
B: If you can remember that red means absolutely no parking and white means that

A: Hey, I got this parking ticket; can you help me figure a way out of it?
B: First of all, did you park somewhere too long or in the wrong spot?
A: I was there too long.
B: Was the area clearly labeled with the time limit and all?
A: Yeah, I saw it.
B: You will need to convince the judge that you couldn't see the signs.
A: Yeah, I understand.
B: Whatever you do, you need to be respectful and polite to the judge.
A: Yeah, you're right.
B: Just try to talk to him about how IF you made a mistake that it won't happen again.
A: OK, I will.
B: Good luck!

A: Man, I got another parking ticket. I am so unlucky--what can I do?
B: Was your car where it wasn't supposed to be, or did you stay there too long?
A: I was in an area where I wasn't supposed to park.
B: Could you tell where you were supposed to park and for how long?
A: I could tell what I was supposed to do.
B: That's too bad. That means that you can't use receipts or a witness to help
A: I guess not.
B: Try brown-nosing the judge, but don't be too obvious about it.
A: Sure, if it will help.
B: Try and convince him that something was labeled wrong or something.
A: Sounds good!
B: Give it your best shot; it might work.

A: I don't know how to fight a parking ticket.
B: Did you get written up for exceeding the time limit or for parking where you
A: Both.
B: Did you see all the signs and just decide to blow them off?
A: I was confused.
B: Maybe you could explain that you are new and got confused--could you do that?
A: If it might work, I'll go for it!
B: Let the judge see that you are only a poor starving student who won't do it
A: I can see how that might work.
B: Without actually saying that the parking ticket guy was an idiot, make it
A: I could do that!
B: Try it. It just might save you the price of a parking ticket.

B: You can get the sports package.
A: Is there a package with basic and movie channels?
B: We have that package.
A: Let me get that package.
B: Is there anything else you would like?
A: That's everything, but can I add channels later?
B: You will be able to add or get rid of channels another day.

A: May I order some cable from you today?

A: What kind of internet is there?
B: You can get DSL or dial-up.
A: Which of those two is best?
B: I would recommend DSL.
A: Is that one better?
B: It's better because it doesn't tie up your phone.
A: What do you mean by that?
B: DSL isn't connected through your phone line, but dial-up is.
A: So then I can't use my phone if I'm on the internet?
B: That's correct. With DSL you can do both.

A: I need to get internet.
B: Which kind of internet connection do you want to get?
A: What kind can I get?
B: There is dial-up or DSL.

A: I'm not sure what that means.
B: Dial-up is connected through your phone, unlike DSL.
A: That'll make it impossible for me to use.
B: Exactly. With DSL you don't have that problem.

A: I'd like to have internet on my computer.
B: Do you know what kind of internet you would like to get?
A: What are my options?
B: You can either get dial-up or DSL.
A: Which one would you recommend?
B: DSL is the best choice.
A: Why is DSL better?
B: It's a lot better because it doesn't tie up your phone line.
A: What exactly does that mean?
B: Well, with dial-up your internet is connected by your phone line.
A: That means that I can't use my phone and the internet at the same time,
B: That's right. You won't have that problem with DSL.

A: Have you been coming to this Laundromat long?
B: I have been washing clothes here since a few years ago.
A: Why is that?
B: It doesn't cost me as much to wash here.
A: I've just started doing my clothes here.
B: Why are you washing your clothes here now?
A: My washing machine broke down.
B: You should just pay someone to fix it.

A: Why do you wash here?
B: It's actually a lot cheaper for me to wash my clothes here.
A: I've only washed my clothes here a couple times.
B: Why don't you wash clothes at home?
A: I would, if my washing machine wasn't broken.
B: Why don't you just get it fixed?
A: I can't afford it.
B: So you plan on washing your clothes here from now on?
A: That's my only option right now.
B: Don't worry. Besides, it's a lot cheaper to wash clothes this way.

A: I'm not sure about how to operate the washer and dryer.
B: What's the problem?
A: I need help turning them on.
B: You need change.
A: The machines take change?

A: That's it?
B: There's nothing else to it.
A: Thank you very much.
B: You're welcome. Let me know if you need anything else.

A: I need help using the washer and dryer.

B: Do you have any change?
A: I need change for the machines?
B: You need to put 50 cents into the washer machine and a dollar into the dryer.
A: So what do I need to do?
B: The machines will turn on once you put the quarters into the slot.
A: That's really all I have to do?
B: That's everything.
A: Thanks for all your help.
B: I'm here if you need any more help.

A: I'm returning your phone call.
B: I'm glad that you could get back to me so fast.
A: No problem, but what were you calling about?

A: Is he messing up in school?
B: He was acting up in class one day last week.
A: What was he doing?
B: He wouldn't stop talking throughout the class.

B: This is true, but it must've slipped my mind.
A: Regardless, all you had to do was give a call.
B: I know. I should've called.
A: Come home late one more time, and you'll find your stuff outside.
B: You want to throw me out over this?
A: That's right, maybe then you'll respect my rules.
B: That's fine, because if I leave, then your rules won't matter.

A: Did you clean your room today?
B: No, not yet.
A: When were you planning on doing that?

A: Didn't I ask you to clean it up earlier?
B: I'm going to clean it.
A: I want you to vacuum in your room, and don't forget to dust everything.
B: I know. I'll do it.
A: Make sure you clean it up before you do anything else.

A: Man, I'm so hungry! Can you buy me a burrito?
B: I don't have any money to buy you a burrito.
A: Please? I haven't eaten anything all day.
B: Look, I only have money to buy myself a burrito.
A: I'm so hungry, I could eat a whole cow!
B: If you're so hungry, why don't you ask someone else for money?
A: I get paid on Friday, I'll pay you back then.
B: Well, I guess on Friday, then you can eat.
A: That's pretty messed up.
B: Why don't you just go home and eat?
A: I don't want to go all the way home just to eat.
B: Well, I guess you're out of luck.

A: I really want a burrito! Can you get me one?
B: I haven't got any money to purchase a burrito for you and me.
A: Would you please buy me one since I haven't eaten today?
B: I only have a few dollars.
A: I could eat a horse right now, I'm so hungry.
B: I want to eat too. Ask someone else to feed you.
A: Since I get my check this Friday, I can give you your money back then.
B: So then, this Friday you'll be able to eat.
A: You're mean to say that.
B: You should just go home and make yourself a sandwich or something.
A: My house is too far, and I'm really hungry.
B: It sounds as if you're going to continue starving.

A: I'm starving! It would be truly appreciated if you bought me a burrito.
B: I'm a little short. I don't have enough for you.
A: I'm starving, as I didn't eat yet today.
B: I really don't have enough money.
A: My stomach feels so empty.
B: Well, why don't you ask Bob for some money? I'm hungry too.
A: I'll be getting money on Friday, and I'll get it back to you then.
B: Okay, so on Friday, you can buy yourself something to eat.
A: That's not nice.
B: You can always go home and make something to eat.
A: I can't go home yet, because I have things to do here.
B: Sorry. That's not my fault.

A: Have you washed any clothes yet?
B: No, I've only washed my whites.
A: When you wash your dark clothes, can you put some of mine in?
B: Sure. Is there any extra care that I should take with your clothes?
A: Just make sure you keep it on the gentle cycle.
B: How many clothes of yours do you want me to wash?
A: There isn't a lot, why, do you have a large load to wash?
B: It's really only a small load.
A: Do you mind washing my clothes?
B: Not at all. It's no problem.
A: Thank you so much.
B: It's no trouble at all.

A: Have you finished washing clothes?
B: I've finished my white clothes. I need to wash the rest.
A: When you do your darks, can you wash some of mine too?

A: It's quite late, and you have an early day tomorrow.
B: I'm not going to be able to fall asleep.
A: Why don't you try counting sheep?
B: I've tried that before. It really doesn't work.
A: That's beside the point, you still need to go to bed.

B: See you in the morning.

A: Shouldn't you already be in bed?
B: I can't sleep. I'm really not all that tired.
A: You need to get some rest, as you have to get up early in the morning.
B: It's impossible for me to get to sleep right now.
A: Just close your eyes, and try not to think.
B: That really does not work for me.
A: It doesn't matter, you need to get some sleep.
B: How about I tire myself out, and then fall asleep when I'm tired?
A: Then you're not going to go to sleep.
B: Don't worry, I'll make sure and get to sleep in a little while.
A: I want you in bed, right now, so sweet dreams.
B: Fine. Sleep well yourself.

A: Isn't it past your bedtime already?
B: I am not sleepy.
A: It's getting late, and you have to wake up early tomorrow.
B: There is no way that I can fall asleep right now.
A: Try listening to some soft music.
B: It won't work. I'm nowhere close to being tired.
A: I really don't care, just go to sleep.
B: What if I stay up and do something, until I get tired?
A: You'll be up all night if I let you do that.
B: I'm going to get to sleep eventually.
A: You need to go to sleep now, so go to sleep.
B: Good night.

A: Wake up, it's time for school.
B: I'm so tired. Let me sleep for five more minutes.
A: You have to get up and get ready for school.
B: I know, but just five more minutes.
A: I can't let you go back to sleep, because you won't wake back up.
B: I promise I'll wake up, in five minutes.
A: You still need to eat breakfast, take a shower, and get dressed.
B: I realize that, and I can do all that when I wake up in five minutes.
A: I don't want you to be late for school today.
B: I'm not going to be late today.
A: Fine, five more minutes.
B: Thank you.

A: Get up, it's time for you to get ready.
B: Let me just get five more minutes of sleep.
A: I would, but you need to start getting ready for school.
B: I understand, but all I want is five more minutes of sleep.
A: If I let you go back to sleep, I know that you won't get up in five minutes.
B: Trust me. I'm going to wake up.

A: I'll let you sleep for a little while longer.
B: I really appreciate that.

A: It's time for you to wake up.
B: Give me five more minutes. I'm really tired this morning.
A: I'm sorry, but it's time for you to get ready for school.
B: I get that, but let me just sleep for a little bit longer.
A: You're not going to get up in five minutes if I let you fall back asleep.
B: Believe me. I will get up and get ready in five minutes.
A: There's a lot that you need to do this morning.
B: I understand, and it will get done after I wake up in five minutes.
A: I would like for you to not be late for school.
B: I'm going to be on time today.
A: Go back to sleep then, but only five more minutes.
B: Thanks a lot.

A: Do you enjoy going on dates?
B: Yes. I find dates to be a lot of fun.
A: What's so fun about them?
B: They give me the opportunity to get to know someone better.
A: So you always have fun on dates?
B: Not always. I don't always like the person I'm on the date with.
A: Why not?
B: My date may not be my type.
A: So then why would you ask them out in the first place?
B: I didn't realize until after our date that they weren't my type.
A: Sounds like a huge waste of time to me.
B: Now that I think about it, it really is sometimes.

A: Do you like dating?
B: It's really a lot of fun.
A: What makes it so much fun?
B: It makes it easier to get to know somebody.
A: Are dates always fun to you?
B: Sometimes I may not like the person I'm having a date with.
A: Why is that?
B: The other person isn't always my type.
A: Why would you bother going out with them then?
B: I didn't know that they weren't my type until after I got to know them better.
A: It seems to me that you're wasting your time.
B: You are absolutely correct, sometimes it is a waste.

A: Are dates fun for you?
B: I enjoy dating a lot.
A: Why are they so fun for you?
B: Dates allow me to meet new people.
A: Your dates are always fun?
B: Well, I don't always like who I'm dating; so not always.
A: How come?
B: The person I am dating may not be my type.
A: How come you asked them out if they weren't your type?
B: You don't always know what type of person you go on a date with until you know them well enough.
A: Dating sounds pointless.
B: Now that you mention it, sometimes you're right.

A: Can I ask you a question?
B: Sure, what's up?
A: Well, I was just wondering if you'd like to go out this Friday.
B: Really?
A: Yeah, I was thinking we could get a bite to eat and catch a movie.
B: That sounds like fun.
A: Of course, we can do something else if you'd like.
B: No, no, dinner and a movie sounds great.
A: Well, what time would you like me to pick you up?
B: How about 7:30?
A: That sounds good, so I'll see you then.
B: Okay, cool.

A: May I ask you a quick question?
B: Of course.
A: How would you like to go on a date with me this Friday?
B: Seriously?
A: Well, I figured that we could go see a movie and get some dinner.
B: Cool, that sounds like it will be fun.
A: We can always do something else if you'd rather.
B: Not at all. I would love to go to dinner and a movie.
A: That's great, so what time do you want me to come get you?
B: Is 7:30 okay?
A: Friday at 7:30 sounds perfect.
B: Great. See you then.

A: Can I ask you something?
B: Sure you can. What's going on?
A: Would you go out with me on Friday?
B: Are you for real?
A: I thought that we could go to dinner and a movie.
B: That actually sounds like it would be a lot of fun.
A: Unless there's something else you would prefer to do.
B: Actually, I would really like to go to dinner and a movie.
A: What time do you want me to come by and pick you up?
B: Is 7:30 cool with you?
A: That's perfect, so I'll see you then.
B: Perfect. I will see you on Friday.

A: Todd, how have you been?

B: Would you be interested in letting me take you to the movies on Friday? Maybe
A: I think I would enjoy seeing a movie with you on Friday.
B: I am not sure what movies are out right now. Have you heard of any that you
A: I think that that new movie, "Australia," looks like it might be good.
B: That movie sounded interesting to me too. If I picked you up at 7:00, would

A: Mia, could I interest you in some lunch down the street at my favorite cafe?
B: Yes, it's a great day for a little walk and some lunch.

A: Hi, I am looking for a woman named Mia.
B: I think I am who you are looking for. You have got to be Rubin, then.

B: Rubin! Karen and Mike have spoken about you so often that I feel like I've
A: I hope that what they had to say was mostly good!
B: They only said wonderful things about you. You did a good job of finding me.
A: Finding the beautiful woman in a red dress next to the fountain wasn't all

A: You know, now that I think about it, I really don't have much more to say to
B: Whatever you say!

A: Brian and Christina were mentioning that maybe it would be

A: Are you kidding me?
B: You know what? You and I had no plans, so I made plans with Mark. What's the
A: We have been together for a year and usually, people who've been together a

A: The free stuff, you know, the soap, lotion, shampoo, etc.
B: I see. Sir, if I may ask: Have you used up all the amenities in your room?
A: Not at all. I still have enough for the next few days.
B: Then what is the problem, sir?
A: I need some to keep as souvenirs!
B: Souvenirs?
A: Yes, souvenirs. Trinkets to remember my trip by!

A: That's not the same. I never pay for hotel souvenirs!
B: I'll call housekeeping. Someone will be up with more amenities shortly.

A: I need more amenities, please.
B: Could you be a little more specific, sir?
A: To be more specific, the free stuff, like soap, lotion, and shampoo.
B: I understand. Now, you're saying that you've already used up all your
A: No! I've got all I need for my stay here.
B: So, what's the problem?
A: I need souvenirs!
B: You want some souvenirs!
A: Yes, yes. Souvenirs.
B: But, sir, our souvenir shop carries all those items.
A: That's not the same thing. If you buy hotel souvenirs, they have no
B: I understand, sir. I'll call housekeeping. You'll have your souvenirs

A: How do I get more amenities?
B: I'm sorry, sir. I'm not sure I understand.
A: I'm talking about the free stuff, like soap and shampoo.
B: Oh, I see. So, you're saying that you've already run out of your amenities.
A: No, no. I've got plenty left.
B: Now I'm confused again! What is the problem?
A: What am I going to do about souvenirs?
B: Oh, I get it! You want souvenirs!
A: Yes, I've got enough soap for my use, but no extra soap for souvenirs.
B: Sir, our souvenir shop carries all those items, and as a guest you get a

B: Okay, I got it. You've already run out of all your amenities?
A: No, I still have plenty left, even if I took three baths a day.
B: I'm more confused now than before. How is there a problem?
A: I need to take home some souvenirs!
B: Okay, finally I understand. You would like souvenirs!
A: Yes, souvenirs that I can take home and add to my collection.
B: If it's souvenirs you want, sir, just visit our souvenir shop. It has

B: Oh, now I understand! So, you've already used up all your amenities?
A: No, I'm not even halfway through my supply.
B: I'm losing you, sir. What's the problem?
A: What's the use of going to a hotel if you don't take home souvenirs?
B: Okay, I got it. You're collecting souvenirs!
A: There you go. My friends expect me to bring home souvenirs.
B: Have you visited our souvenir shop, sir? It's loaded with all kinds of items.
A: I've never paid for a hotel souvenir in my life, and I don't intend to start
B: Sir, housekeeping will bring you a basketful of amenities momentarily.

B: A dime is still a bargain, sir.

A: I need to make a copy of a document as soon as possible.
B: No problem, sir. There's a copy machine in our computer lab.
A: Very good. How much does each copy cost?
B: Each copy will cost you a dime, sir.
A: A dime? I remember when copies used to cost a nickel.
B: There aren't many things you can get for a nickel, sir.

A: Can you tell me where I could make a copy of a document right now?
B: Sir, you can come downstairs right now to the computer lab.

B: Sir, each copy is ten cents or one dime, whichever you prefer.

B: Sir, is everything all right?
A: My wife just collapsed on the floor!

A: Okay, but hurry.
B: Stay calm, sir, and talk clearly.

A: Get a doctor here, immediately!
B: What's the problem, sir?
A: My wife is on the floor, she's unconscious!

A: Hurry up, please.
B: I'm connecting you now, sir.

A: A doctor! I need a doctor!

A: You're right, I'm beside myself with worry.
B: Hold on, sir. I'm connecting you with 911.
A: Time is critical. Hurry up!

B: You would have to use the computer lab. I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

A: I need broadband for my computer.

A: I'm leaving. Here is my key.
B: Just one second, sir, and I'll give you your receipt. Here you go.
A: Thank you very much.
B: Sir, did you enjoy your stay here?
A: Most of my time here was pleasant. And New York itself is fantastic.

A: I'm out of here. Here's my key.
B: Give me just a few seconds, sir, and I'll hand you your receipt. Here you
A: I thank you.

A: My amenities bill says that I owe $10 for a movie, but I never
B: Let's see. It says that you were charged Monday at 9:00 p.m. for the movie
A: That's absolutely wrong! I was out exploring the city Monday night.
B: Okay, let me see what I can do.
A: Thank you. I didn't think it would be this simple.
B: I can take the $10 off your bill, but I need to charge you $2 for the
A: Are you serious? I have to pay $2 for a movie I never watched?
B: Unfortunately, sir, it's how the computer is programmed.
A: This is outrageous! I'm never coming back to this hotel again!
B: I'm sorry, sir. Perhaps you'd like to write a letter to headquarters.

A: I just discovered that I owe $10 for a movie that I never ordered.
B: Let me check, sir. You were charged for watching "Titanic" Monday night.
A: That is absolutely incorrect! I was out on the town Monday night.
B: Okay, sir, bear with me a moment.
A: Thank you for taking my word over the computer's word.
B: One slight problem, sir. I need to charge you $2 to remove this error from
A: You can't be serious. You're making me pay $2 for a movie I never watched?
B: I feel your pain, sir.
A: Absolutely unbelievable! You people should be ashamed of yourselves.
B: I agree with you, sir, but all I do is work here.

A: You guys are charging me $10 for a movie that I never ordered or saw.
B: Let's see, sir. According to your file, you watched "Titanic" Monday evening.
A: The wrong information is in my file. I was at a concert Monday night.
B: Well, your word overrules the file, sir. One moment, please.
A: I knew you'd see it my way.
B: Sir, I deleted the $10, but I had to add a $2 service charge to your bill.
A: Am I in the Twilight Zone? You're charging me for a movie I never saw?
B: Please don't blame me, sir. Blame the computer programmer.
A: This is highway robbery. I've got a good mind to call the police!
B: If it makes you feel any better, other guests feel the same way.

A: Why am I being charged $10 for a movie that I never ordered?
B: Sir, according to your file, you spent Monday evening watching "Titanic."
A: The file is wrong. I was at a great concert that night.
B: Well, this wouldn't be the first time that a file was wrong. Just a moment,
A: Thank you for taking care of it so quickly.
B: Sir, when I deleted the $10, the program automatically added a $2 service
A: You can't do that! You can't charge me for a mistake that you made!
B: Sometimes you can't win for losing, sir.
A: Now I've seen it all! What a rip-off this place is!
B: I don't blame you, sir. Two dollars is a lot of money.

A: I need to know why I'm being charged $10 for a movie that I never
B: Hmm. Your file shows that you watched "Titanic" Monday night.
A: Monday night? Monday night I was at a great concert.
B: Well, as they say, garbage in, garbage out. Let me correct this error,
A: Thank you. It's very nice when problems can be solved quickly.
B: When I deleted the $10, the computer automatically added a $2 service charge.
A: Are you crazy? You made the mistake and now you're charging me for your
B: Sir, if it makes you feel any better, the $2 service fee used to be $5.
A: Why don't you just stick a gun in my ribs and take everything I have?
B: Unfortunately, sir, you'll have to pay the $2, whether you like it or not.

A: I'm checking out in about half an hour.
B: Whenever you're ready to check out, I'll be ready, sir.
A: Great! As you know however, the day in New York has hardly begun.
B: You're right. It's only 9:00 a.m.
A: Therefore, I think I'll explore New York some more. But I need to store my
B: Sir, our storage facility is merely $5 an hour. You also need to leave a
A: My luggage isn't enough of a deposit?
B: Unfortunately, it isn't. VISA or MasterCard will suffice, though.
A: Let me put on my thinking cap for a moment.
B: Better hurry, sir. Remember you have to check out in less than half an hour.

A: I should tell you that I'm checking out in about 30 minutes.
B: I'm ready when you are, sir.
A: Very good! Now, it's still morning here in New York.
B: You are so right, sir. The clock just struck nine.
A: I'm going to spend some time exploring the city. What can I do with my
B: Sir, right here we have a storage site. Its only $5 an hour, but you need to
A: A deposit? Isn't my luggage a deposit?
B: I'm sorry, sir, but it isn't. Your MasterCard or VISA will take care of
A: Let me think about this.
B: Okay, sir. But don't take too long. You only have 30 minutes.

A: Do you know that I'm checking out in about 30 minutes?
B: Just say the word, sir.
A: Excellent! Now, as you know, the day has barely begun.
B: I agree. The dew is still on the grass.
A: I want to hit a few more places in the city, but I need a place to put my
B: We do have a storage space for your bags. There's a small charge, plus a
A: Leave a deposit? Isn't leaving the luggage enough of a deposit?
B: Regrettably, no. But simply present your VISA to cover your deposit.
A: I'll have to think about this for a second.
B: Okay, sir, but don't think too long. Your checkout is only 30 minutes away.

A: In case you didn't know, I'm checking out in half an hour.
B: That won't be a problem, sir.
A: That's good to hear. Now there's still a whole New York day ahead of me.
B: You're right, sir. Your whole day is still ahead of you.
A: I still have time to explore more of New York, but I need a place to secure
B: We have a storage place here, but you have to leave a deposit.
A: A deposit, huh? I would think my baggage would be enough of a deposit.
B: Just present your VISA card, and there won't be any problems.
A: That deposit bothers me. Give me a minute.
B: Okay, sir, but remember how close it is to your checkout time.

A: I'll be checking out of the hotel in about 30 minutes.
B: Thirty minutes or 30 seconds, sir, it doesn't matter, I'm ready for you.
A: Great! As you know, however, the day in New York has hardly begun.
B: There's nothing like getting an early start, sir.
A: What can I do with my baggage while I visit a few more tourist spots?
B: You can leave your baggage in our storage space, with a deposit.
A: Isn't my baggage enough of a deposit?
B: I wish it was, but it isn't. They will still want a credit card.
A: It's always something, isn't it? Let me think about this for a second.
B: Don't forget that you have very little time, sir, before you have to check

A: I'd like to leave a parcel for one of my friends. Is that okay?
B: All I need is your name, the name of your friend, and the time of pick-up.

B: That would be most convenient for me. Thanks for your consideration!

A: It worked out well that the wine that I brought to share seems to blend well
B: I love this wine! It goes very well with the chicken.

A: George, how is your chicken?
B: My chicken tastes all right, but it is pretty dry. How is your fish?
A: My fish is pretty dry too.
B: It's almost as if this food has been sitting a little too long. It doesn't
A: Yes, it seems that way to me also.
B: How are your vegetables?
A: My vegetables are very soggy.
B: Mine are the same way. It seems like they've been overcooked.
A: I don't usually complain, but I think that we should mention this to the
B: I agree. Maybe they can bring us some better food.

A: George, is your chicken OK?
B: It tastes great, but it is really dry. Is your fish all right?
A: My fish is very dry.
B: I wonder if they left it sitting around too long before they served it.
A: That's exactly what I was thinking had happened.
B: Are your vegetables OK?
A: The vegetables are kind of mushy.
B: So are mine. I think they left them cooking too long.
A: The food here is usually good, so I think that we should tell the waiter that
B: I think that you are right. Maybe they can give us a free dessert or

A: Does your chicken taste all right?
B: The chicken tastes wonderful, but it is kind of dry. Is your fish OK?
A: My fish has good seasoning but is a little dry.
B: It seems as if they got busy and left it sitting before it got to us.
A: Yes, maybe they are short-handed in the kitchen tonight.
B: Are your vegetables a little mushy?
A: The vegetables seem to not be very fresh.
B: Mine aren't so good, either.
A: I usually enjoy the meals here, so I think that we should tell the waiter
B: I think that we should let someone know. They will probably want to fix the

A: Do you want some dessert?
B: No thanks. We just need our check. Have you seen the waitress?
A: Here comes our waitress with our check.
B: The service here has been really great, don't you think?
A: Yes, the service was quite good.
B: So, let's look at the check. The total is $36.00.
A: How much do you think we should leave for a tip?
B: Usually people leave 15 percent, but this was exceptional service. I am thinking
A: I agree that 20 percent would be just about right.
B: OK, so that will bring her tip to $7.20. Add it to the $36.00 and the total
A: Yes, what a nice dinner that was!
B: We'll have to make sure to come back here again real soon.

A: Would you like some more coffee?
B: No thanks. I'm full. We need to find our waitress and get our bill.
A: The waitress is bringing the bill right now.
B: This waitress has really been on top of things, hasn't she?
A: Yes, this waitress did a great job.
B: OK, let's see what the damage is. The total for our meal is $36.00.
A: What do you think would be the right amount to leave for a tip?
B: Fifteen percent is a normal tip, but she really did a great job. What do you
A: Yes, 20 percent would be perfect.
B: Her tip will end up being $7.20 plus the bill of $36.00. The total will be
A: Yes, that was one fantastic meal!
B: I agree. Maybe we can come back again next week.

A: Would you like to order anything else?
B: No, I'm good. All we need now is our check.
A: The waitress is walking over here with our check even as we speak.
B: I have never had bad service at this restaurant, but this time was really
A: Yes, she really went out of her way to make this a pleasant dining
B: Let's take a look at our bill. The total price for our dinner is $36.00.
A: How much money should we leave for a tip?
B: I know that 15 percent is a normal tip, but I really thought that this waitress went
A: She definitely deserves 20 percent for a tip.
B: So we can add her tip of $7.20 to the bill of $36.00 and the total will be
A: Yes, what a wonderful meal!
B: It absolutely was a great meal. We'll have to return here for lunch sometime.

A: Do you want some dessert?
B: No thanks. We just need our check. Have you seen the waitress?
A: Where is our waitress anyway?
B: Yes, the service hasn't been the best. Is that our waitress over there?
A: I'll walk over and get the bill, since I don't think the waitress is coming
B: Good idea. Just bring it back and we'll figure it out together.
A: So the bill is $36.00.
B: How much do you think we should leave for a tip?
A: My first inclination is to leave nothing for a tip.
B: I agree, but we don't really know the whole story. There may have been
A: Let's leave 10%, so that we at least leave something for the service.
B: I agree. We will leave $3.60 for the tip.

A: Would you like some more coffee?
B: No thanks. I'm full. We need to find our waitress and get our bill.
A: Good luck finding the waitress!
B: The service this evening has kind of sucked. Is that our server over there?
A: I'll go get the check, since our server doesn't seem to be headed this way.
B: Good. I'll just stay here until you get back.
A: So the total is $36.00 for our dinner.
B: How much of a tip do you think our waitress deserves?
A: I wonder if no tip would be appropriate in light of the service.
B: I kind of feel the same way, but they may have just been really short-staffed
A: I think that we should leave 10%.
B: $3.60 will be the right amount for the tip.

A: Would you like to order anything else?

A: I'd rather be cold than hot.
B: Me too.

A: It doesn't look very nice outside today.
B: You're right. I think it's going to rain later.
A: In the middle of the summer, it shouldn't be raining.
B: That wouldn't seem right.
A: Considering that it's over ninety degrees outside, that would be weird.
B: Exactly, it wouldn't be nice if it started raining. It's too hot.
A: I know, you're absolutely right.
B: I wish it would cool off one day.
A: That's how I feel, I want winter to come soon.

B: That's exactly how I feel.

A: I wish it was a nicer day today.
B: That is true. I hope it doesn't rain.
A: It wouldn't rain in the middle of the summer.
B: It wouldn't seem right if it started raining right now.
A: It would be weird if it started raining in ninety degree weather.
B: Any rain right now would be pointless.
A: That's right, it really would be.
B: I want it to cool down some.
A: I know what you mean, I can't wait until it's winter.
B: Winter is great. I wish it didn't get so cold sometimes though.

A: Why is that?

A: Really? Why is it?
B: Because you can see the stars perfectly.
A: I really hope it rains today.
B: Yeah, me too.

B: It really is.
A: It seems that it may rain today.
B: Hopefully it will.

A: I'm doing really well.
B: Tad, I'm pretty hungry right now. Want to walk over and check out the food
A: Julie, do you know who that woman is over there by the window?
B: That is Mary. I heard that she's just moved in with Lee.
A: I thought that he was with Malia.
B: Oh, that relationship is history. Malia hooked up with a guy she met on
A: I bet that Lee wasn't too happy with that!
B: Actually, he was OK with it. They hadn't been getting along too well.

A: Hi Julie, how are you?
B: Things are going good, Tad. How about you?
A: Things have been going well for me.
B: That food smells delicious! Let's wander over to the food table and see

A: How did Lee feel about that happening?
B: He took it pretty well. I think that he had kind of had his eye on Mary for a

A: Their wedding was absolutely beautiful.
B: It really was. I want a wedding like that.
A: How much do you think they spent on their wedding?

A: Their wedding was so beautiful.
B: I agree completely. I hope that I have a wedding like that one day.
A: How much do you reckon it cost to pull that wedding off?
B: I think it cost them a lot of money.
A: Do you hope to have a wedding as big as theirs?
B: I don't think so. I want to have a smaller wedding.
A: Not me.
B: Why do you want a bigger wedding?
A: I want to have a large wedding that everyone will remember.
B: You can have a small wedding, and people will still remember it.
A: Whatever flicks your Bic.
B: That is true.

B: What plans are you talking about?
A: Your plans as far as college.
B: I want to transfer.
A: You want to transfer?
B: That's what I plan to do.
A: Where do you want to transfer to?
B: I want to go to school out of state.
A: Which state?
B: Maybe New York.
A: That would be a big move.
B: I'm still thinking about it.

A: Tell me your plans.
B: I'm not sure what plans you're referring to.
A: I'm talking about your college plans.
B: I'm going to transfer colleges.
A: Is that right?
B: That's what I'm working on doing.
A: Where are you going to transfer to?
B: I don't know yet. Somewhere out of state, probably.
A: Which state exactly?
B: New York would be nice.
A: That's pretty far away.
B: I know it's a big move. That's why I'm still thinking about it.

A: What plans have you made?
B: My plans as far as what?
A: Your plans for college.
B: Oh. I plan on transferring.
A: Oh, really?
B: Yeah. That's the plan.
A: What school are you transferring to?
B: I want to transfer to a school out of state.
A: Which state are you thinking of?
B: I wouldn't mind transferring to a school in New York.
A: That's on the other side of the country.
B: I know, but I'm still weighing my options.

A: What classes have you taken so far?
B: I've been working on my GE classes.
A: Is that all?
B: That's it for right now.
A: What about your other classes?
B: I'm working towards transferring schools.
A: Which classes have you finished already?
B: I've finished all my English and math classes.
A: How many classes do you have left for your GE?
B: Only three.
A: That's amazing.
B: I'm almost ready to transfer.

A: Which classes have you completed?
B: I have been taking classes for my General Education.
A: Those are the only classes?
B: That's all I need to take right now.
A: Why don't you take any other classes?
B: I'm just working on transferring right now.
A: What classes are you done with?
B: I'm done with all my math and English classes.
A: How many more classes do you need to finish for your GE?
B: I have three more.
A: That's great!
B: I just need three more classes, and I can transfer.

A: What classes have you been taking?
B: I've been taking my GE classes.
A: That's it?
B: That's all that I need right now.
A: Why haven't you been taking any other classes?
B: I'm taking classes so that I can transfer soon.
A: What classes have you taken so far?
B: I don't need to take any more English or math classes.
A: How many GE classes do you have left?

A: Are you planning on taking classes next semester?
B: Yeah. That's the plan.
A: What classes are you going to take?
B: I'm going to take an English and a math class.
A: What else are you taking?
B: I'm also going to take a psychology class.
A: Is that for your major?
B: It counts toward my major, but I'm taking it as part of my GE.
A: So you're working on finishing your GE?
B: That's all I'm trying to do right now.
A: Why are you only working on your GE classes?
B: Once I finish those classes, then I can transfer.

A: Are you going to take classes next semester?
B: I plan to.
A: Which classes?
B: I will be taking another English and math class.
A: Is there anything else?
B: I'm going to take a psychology class.
A: Are you taking the psychology class as part of your major?
B: It goes toward my GE and my major.
A: So, you're just working on your GE right now?
B: Yeah. That's the plan for right now.
A: Why only your GE classes?
B: I'll be able to transfer once I finish those classes.

A: Were you going to take some classes next semester?
B: Of course!
A: Which ones?
B: I need to take another English and math class.
A: That's it?
B: I think I may also sign up for a psych class.
A: Is the psychology class for your major?
B: That class will count toward my GE and my major.
A: You're just trying to finish your GE?
B: I need to finish these classes for now.
A: I don't understand why you're only working on your GE classes.
B: Because I can't transfer until I finish those classes.

A: What are you doing?
B: I'm just filling out applications.
A: Applications for what?
B: I'm filling out college applications.

A: You have plenty of time to think about it.
B: What do I need to do in order to transfer?
A: You're going to need to finish your General Education.
B: How many classes is that?
A: The GE is 60 credits worth of classes.
B: Is that a lot?
A: You can finish in about two years.
B: Oh. That shouldn't be a problem at all.

A: Can I help you?
B: May I talk to you about transferring schools?
A: Where would you like to transfer to?
B: I haven't figured that out yet.
A: You have more than enough time to figure it out.
B: What must I do to transfer?
A: First, you have to complete your General Education.
B: How many GE classes are there?
A: You need 60 credits of GE classes.

B: That shouldn't be too hard.

A: Can you help me with something, sir?
B: What do you need?

A: Where would you like to go to school?
B: I really don't know.
A: You can't think of anything?
B: I really like where I'm at now.

B: It should be coming soon.
A: It better, because I'm already late for work.
B: I can't stand riding the bus.
A: Me too, it's so unreliable.
B: That is true.
A: It's also horrible having to be at a bus stop in any kind of weather.
B: Exactly.That's the worst part.
A: I think it's time we started driving.
B: Yes, I agree.

A: When is the bus going to get here?

A: We need to get a car.
B: I completely agree with that.

A: Is this our bus stop?
B: I think this is it. Get off.
A: Dude, where are we at?
B: I have no idea.
A: I thought this was the right stop.
B: It doesn't look right to me.
A: Did you make us get off early?
B: I think we did.
A: I should not have listened to you.
B: I really thought this was our stop.
A: Now we have to walk.
B: Maybe we should just wait for the next bus.

A: I'm not sure, is this our stop?
B: Yeah, get off the bus.
A: Do you have any idea where we are?
B: I'm really not sure.
A: This can't be the right stop.
B: I don't think this is right.
A: We got off too early, didn't we?
B: Yeah, we did get off too early.
A: I should've just stayed on the bus.
B: I messed up.
A: Great, we have to walk now.
B: You want to wait for the next bus?

A: Are we supposed to get off right here?
B: I think so; hurry up and get off.
A: Where are we?
B: I don't know.
A: You said this was the right stop.
B: I think I was wrong.
A: Did we get off the bus too early?
B: I don't know; it kind of looks like we did.
A: Why did you tell me to get off?
B: I'm sorry. I thought this was our stop.
A: I really don't feel like walking.
B: We could always wait for the next bus to come.

B: I know.
A: Did we miss our stop?
B: I'm not sure.
A: Didn't you say you knew where to get off the bus?
B: I don't know. We may have missed our stop.
A: Are you serious?
B: Yeah, we did miss it.
A: I can't catch the bus with you anymore.
B: Sorry.

A: Do you know which stop we get off at?
B: We still have more to go, I think.
A: We've been on this bus for a while now.
B: You're right.
A: Should we have gotten off the bus already?
B: I don't think so.
A: I thought you knew.

A: What's wrong, officer?

B: You didn't see the red light?
A: I'm sorry for running it, but I really didn't know.
B: Didn't you learn that red means stop?
A: I know that.
B: Then tell me why you sped up on the yellow light.
A: I'm not sure.
B: I'm giving you a ticket for this.
A: I'm sorry for the misunderstanding.
B: Maybe you'll think about this before you decide to run another light.

A: Why'd you pull me over?
B: Are you aware that you drove through a red light?
A: I ran a red light?
B: Yes, you did.
A: I apologize, but I didn't realize that I did that.
B: Weren't you taught that yellow means slow down, not speed up?
A: I did learn that.
B: So, then why did you speed up?
A: I don't know what to tell you.
B: I'm going to have to write you a ticket.
A: I understand.
B: Here you go. Don't do that again.

B: I appreciate your understanding.

A: You want to argue your ticket today?

B: I was pulled over for allegedly speeding.
A: Are you sure you weren't speeding?
B: To be honest, I really wasn't.

A: Don't worry about it.
B: I'm so glad for your help.

A: Are you here about your ticket?
B: Yes, I am, Your Honor.

A: You must've been speeding.
B: No, Your Honor, I was not.
A: Tell me how many miles per hour you were going.
B: I was going 35 in a 40 mph zone.
A: That's fine, so I'll let you go with a warning.
B: So, I don't have to pay the ticket?
A: You won't have to pay the fine.
B: Thank you very much, Your Honor.

A: Why are you in court today?
B: I got a ticket, and I would like to fight it.
A: Is the officer that pulled you over here today?
B: He's here.
A: Tell me what happened.
B: The officer says that I ran a red light, but I didn't.
A: The officer wouldn't lie about that.
B: He must've, because the signal had a camera on top of it.
A: There was no picture taken of your license plate?
B: I don't believe it took my picture.
A: I'm just going to let you go.
B: I appreciate that.

A: What are you doing here today?
B: I would like to fight my ticket.
A: Is the arresting officer in the courtroom today?
B: Yes, the officer is here today.
A: What's your case?

A: Since there is no picture of your license plate on record, I'm going to let
B: Thank you. I'm glad that you believe me.

B: Do you have the ticket with you?
A: Yes, I have my ticket with me.
B: Let me see your ID.
A: I forgot to bring that with me.
B: You need it to pay your fine.
A: Why can't I just give you the money for the fine?
B: Because, I need to see a photo ID in order to verify who you are.
A: I think I understand.
B: All right, come back and bring your ID.
A: So once I pay this off, my record will be cleared?
B: Once you pay it, your record will be cleared.

A: I don't have it.
B: You can't pay your fine without your ID.
A: I don't understand why I can't just pay you.
B: We have to make sure that the person issued the ticket is the one paying it.
A: I get it now.
B: Just come back when you have your ID with you.

B: Only if you pay your fine.

A: I have a parking ticket to pay for.
B: Did you bring your ticket?
A: Yes, I remembered to bring my ticket with me today.

A: Why is that?
B: I don't like that candidate.
A: Why don't you like him?
B: I do not find him to be very intelligent.
A: He is very smart.
B: He's not smart, and I don't agree with any of his policies.

B: That's great news!

A: Have you heard who got elected?
B: No, who won?
